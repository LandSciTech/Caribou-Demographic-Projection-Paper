	abstract = {Abstract: Survival estimation is an important aspect of population ecology and conservation biology, and radiotelemetry is a major tool for assessing factors influencing survival time in free-ranging birds and mammals. Despite the advantage of telemetry in providing extensive and continuous survival information, telemetry-based survival estimates can be biased or imprecise when methods are misused. Simple cumulative survival estimators like the Heisey and Fuller and Kaplan-Meier methods have underlying assumptions and sampling requirements that commonly remain unverified by researchers. Telemetry studies often limit survival analysis to simple univariate tests that do not consider the range of factors potentially influencing mortality risk in free-ranging animals. Continuous-time modeling approaches like Cox Proportional Hazards or Anderson–Gill methods, or their discrete-time analogues, are superior because they are robust to a range of study design limitations and can handle multiple categorical or continuous covariates including those that vary with time or subject age. Parametric models may be difficult to fit in telemetry studies because the appropriate hazard function in wildlife populations usually is not known. The main assumptions in survival study design are that 1) subjects represent the population of interest, 2) mortality risk is independent between subjects, and 3) subjects are lost to follow-up (i.e., censored) randomly. These assumptions are prone to violation in telemetry research, and their assessment and possible remediation should be prioritized. Telemetry studies often are characterized by small sample size or short duration; both attributes lead to low numbers of mortalities and thus lack of precision in the survival estimate. I conclude that telemetry-based survival estimation will benefit from increased emphasis on modeling approaches designed to elucidate survival determinants in complex systems, combined with more rigorous attention to basic assumptions and study design limitations.},

	abstract = {Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are threatened in Canada, with population and distribution declines evident in most regions of the country. Causes of declines are linked to landscape change from forest fires and human development, notably forestry oil and gas activities, which result in caribou habitat loss and affect ecosystem food webs. The Federal Species at Risk Act requires effective protection and restoration of caribou habitat, with actions to increase caribou survival. These requirements call for effective monitoring of caribou population trends to gauge success. Many woodland caribou populations are nearly impossible to count using traditional aerial survey methods, but demographic-based monitoring approaches can be used to estimate population trends based on population modeling of vital rates from marked animals. Monitoring programs have used a well-known simple population model (the Recruitment-Mortality [R/M] equation) to estimate demographic rates for woodland caribou, but have faced challenges in managing large data streams and providing transparency in the demographic estimation process. We present a stand-alone statistical software application using open-source software to permit efficient, transparent, and replicable demographic estimation for woodland caribou populations. We developed an easy-to-use, interactive web-based application for the R/M population model that uses a Bayesian estimation approach and provides the user flexibility in choice of prior distributions and other output features. We illustrate the web-application to the A la Pêche Southern Mountain (Central Group) woodland caribou population in west-central Alberta, Canada, during 1998–2017. Our estimates of population demographics are consistent with previous research on this population and highlight the utility of the application in assessing caribou population responses to species recovery actions. We provide example data, computer code, the web-based application package, and a user manual to guide installation and use. We also review underlying assumptions and challenges of population monitoring in this case study. We expect our software will contribute to efficient monitoring of woodland caribou and help in the assessment of recovery actions for this species. © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we pay specific attention to various forms of censoring and truncation that present challenges for telemetry-based monitoring of survival. We use simulations to assess how uncertainty about times of death and imperfect detection probabilities affect Kaplan–Meier survival estimates. We then treat monitoring of threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in west-central Alberta as a case study to test for potential effects of non-random right censoring and interval censoring on survival estimates. We report that monitoring frequency (e.g., daily vs. monthly) and associated uncertainty about the exact time of death do not inherently induce bias on Kaplan–Meier point estimates of survival nor affect estimates of variance. Removing individuals from the at-risk pool during intervals for which they were not detected did induce a negative bias on resulting survival estimates when the probability of detection was independent of the animals' fates. We recommend using subsequent detections to impute animals' fates during missed intervals in such cases when all animals' fates are eventually known or permanently right censored and when missed detections are not related to changes in mortality risk. Although some assumptions remain difficult to test and of continued concern, we find no evidence of biases in the methodology of Alberta's woodland caribou monitoring program. Our results lend credence to recent evidence of widespread declines in woodland caribou populations across the province. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

Although adult female survival has the highest elasticity for ungulate population dynamics, the more variable recruitment rates are commonly monitored to track local variation in growth rates. Specifically, recruitment is often measured using late winter young:adult age ratios, though these age ratios are difficult to reliably interpret given the contribution of multiple vital rates to annual ratios. We show that the supplementation of age ratio data with concurrent radio-telemetry monitoring of adult female survival allows both retrospective estimation of empirical population growth rates and the decomposition of recruitment-specific vital rates. We demonstrate the estimation of recruitment and population growth rates for 1 woodland caribou population using these methods, including elasticity and life-stage simulation analysis of the relative contribution of adult female survival and recruitment rates to variation in population growth. We show, for this woodland caribou population, that adult female survival and recruitment rates were nearly equivalent drivers of population growth. We recommend the concurrent monitoring of adult female survival to reliably interpret age ratios when managing caribou and other ungulates. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {The decline of many woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations is thought to be linked with habitat disturbances resulting from industrial development, including timber harvesting and its network of haul roads. Defining a disturbance-abundance relationship offers a tool to assess and potentially manage for the influence of disturbance on caribou abundance. Defining this relationship is challenged by limited historical land use and abundance data, the choice of a disturbance measure, and variability in the relationship between subpopulations and across core versus matrix habitat. For 12 subpopulations of woodland caribou within the southern mountain population, we linked longitudinal caribou abundance data with historical forestry disturbances simulated from forest harvest data. We compared disturbance measures estimating the proportion of forested area commercially harvested with even-aged, regeneration treatments (cutblocks) and converted to roads for transporting timber within subpopulation-specific core and matrix habitats as predictors of caribou abundance. Non-linear mixed models provided evidence that disturbances in matrix habitats negatively influenced caribou abundance, with the effects in core habitat being variable between subpopulations. Of the disturbance types evaluated, the best predictors included roads buffered by 50 m (R50), cutblocks ≤80 years old, and the cumulation of cutblocks ≤80 years old plus roads buffered by 50 m. The top-ranked model was composed of R50 present in core and in matrix habitats. This model predicted a 42\% (95\% CI = 33–51\%) reduction in caribou abundance for every 1\% increase in matrix R50 (holding core R50 constant). Given the lack of pre-forestry abundance data, we failed to directly derive critical disturbance thresholds; however, our models could be used to estimate subpopulation-specific habitat-disturbance thresholds necessary to achieve abundance targets. We recommend that in addition to existing protections of core habitat, few if any new roads should be built in core habitat, and that timber harvest in matrix habitat should be designed to minimize the establishment of associated roads.},

	abstract = {Integrated population models (IPMs) represent the single, unified analysis of population count data and demographic data. This modelling framework is quite novel and can be implemented within the classical or the Bayesian mode of statistical inference. Here, we briefly show the basic steps that need to be taken when an integrated population model is adopted, and review existing integrated population models for birds and mammals. There are important advantages of integrated compared to conventional analyses that analyse each dataset separately and then try to make an inference about population dynamics. First, integrated population models allow the estimating of more demographic quantities, because there is information about all demographic processes operating in a population, and this information is exploited. Second, parameter estimates become more precise, and this enhances statistical power. Finally, all sources of uncertainty due to process variability and the sampling process(es) are adequately included. Core of the integrated models is the link of changes in the population size and the demographic rates via a demographic model (usually a Leslie matrix model) and the likelihoods of all existing datasets. We discuss some critical assumptions that are typically made in integrated population models and highlight fruitful areas of future research. Currently, we have found 25 studies that used integrated population models. Central to most studies was statistical development rather than their application to address an ecological question, which is not surprising given that integrated population models are still a new development. We predict that integrated population models will become a common and important tool in studies of population dynamics, both in ecology and its applications, such as conservation biology or wildlife management.},

	abstract = {Assessing the impacts of ongoing climate and anthropogenic-induced change on wildlife populations requires understanding species distributions and abundances across large spatial and temporal scales. For threatened or declining populations, collecting sufficient broad-scale data is challenging as sample sizes tend to be low because many such species are rare and/or elusive. As a result, demographic data are often piecemeal, leading to difficulties in determining causes of population changes and developing strategies to mitigate the effects of environmental stressors. Thus, the population dynamics of threatened species across spatio-temporal extents is typically inferred through incomplete, independent, local-scale studies. Emerging integrative modeling approaches, such as integrated population models (IPMs), combine multiple data types into a single analysis and provide a foundation for overcoming problems of sparse or fragmentary data. In this paper, we demonstrate how IPMs can be successfully implemented by synthesizing the elements, advantages, and novel insights of this modeling approach. We highlight the latest developments in IPMs that are explicitly relevant to the ecology and conservation of threatened species, including capabilities to quantify the spatial scale of management, source-sink dynamics, synchrony within metapopulations, and population density effects on demographic rates. Adoption of IPMs has led to improved detection of population declines, adaptation of targeted monitoring schemes, and refined management strategies. Continued methodological advancements of IPMs, such as incorporation of a wider set of data types (e.g., citizen science data) and coupled population-environment models, will allow for broader applicability within ecological and conservation sciences.},

	abstract = {Population monitoring can take many different forms, and monitoring elusive and endangered species frequently involves a variety of sparse data from different sources. Small populations are often hard to sample precisely and without bias, so when estimates of vital rates like survival or recruitment point to conflicting population trends, it can be hard to determine which is more correct. Furthermore, data can be extremely hard to collect on small populations and it can be helpful to find a way to use all available hard-won data. To address these issues, we developed an integrated population model (IPM) using all available data to estimate vital rates and abundance for a case study of an endangered woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) population. This IPM allowed us to incorporate data from juvenile recruitment surveys, telemetry-based survival, aerial population counts and mark–resight data, and non-invasive capture–recapture DNA data to better understand population status and trend. We estimated survival, abundance, and recruitment of four age classes of male and female caribou: young, juveniles, subadults, and adults. The four-age class structure of the IPM allowed us to estimate recruitment from reproductive-aged female caribou alone, even though it can be difficult to distinguish age classes—and even sexes—in the field. As part of our IPM, we developed a novel mixture model to break apart data from different age classes when age is unobservable, as it typically is from non-invasive DNA samples. This helped us decrease bias in juvenile and adult survival estimates from scat data, which was important to our understanding of the population dynamics. Overall, our integrated model provided more precise estimates of population trends than any one method (e.g., telemetry or non-invasive DNA) alone. This IPM provides a useful, flexible tool for biologists to monitor populations and provides a valuable example of the benefits of integrated population modeling approaches for endangered species management and recovery.},

	abstract = {Integrated population models (IPMs) represent a formal statistical methodology for combining multiple data sets such as population counts, band recoveries, and fecundity estimates into a single unified analysis with dual objectives: better estimating population size, trajectory, and vital rates; and formally describing the ecological processes that generated these patterns. Although IPMs have been used in population ecology and fisheries management, their use in wildlife management has been limited. Data sets available for North American waterfowl are unprecedented in terms of time span ({\textgreater}60 years) and geographic coverage, and are especially well-suited for development of IPMs that could improve the understanding of population ecology and help guide future harvest and habitat management decisions. In this overview, we illustrate 3 potential benefits of IPMs: integration of multiple data sources (i.e., population counts, mark-recapture data, and fecundity estimates), increased precision of parameter estimates, and ability to estimate missing demographic parameters by reanalyzing results from a historical study of canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria). Drawing from our own published and unpublished work, we demonstrate how IPMs could be used to identify the critical vital rates that have had the greatest influence on population change in lesser scaup (Aythya affinis), evaluate potential mechanisms of harvest compensation for American black ducks (Anas rubripes), or prioritize the most appropriate places to conduct habitat management to benefit northern pintails (Anas acuta). Integrated population models provide a powerful platform for evaluating alternative hypotheses about population regulation and they have potential to advance the understanding of wildlife ecology and help managers make ecologically based decisions. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Recovering endangered species is a difficult and often controversial task that challenges status quo land uses. Southern Mountain caribou are a threatened ecotype of caribou that historically ranged in southwestern Canada and northwestern USA and epitomize the tension between resource extraction, biodiversity conservation, and Indigenous Peoples' treaty rights. Human-induced habitat alteration is considered the ultimate cause of caribou population declines, whereby an increased abundance of primary prey—such as moose and deer—elevates predator populations and creates unsustainable caribou mortality. Here we focus on the Klinse-Za and Quintette subpopulations, part of the endangered Central Group of Southern Mountain caribou in British Columbia. These subpopulations were trending toward immediate extirpation until a collaborative group initiated recovery by implementing two short-term recovery actions. We test the effectiveness of these recovery actions—maternity penning of adult females and their calves, and the reduction of a primary predator, wolves—in increasing vital rates and population growth. Klinse-Za received both recovery actions, whereas Quintette only received wolf reductions, providing an opportunity to test efficacy between recovery actions. Between 1995 and 2021, we followed 162 collared female caribou for 414 animal-years to estimate survival and used aerial counts to estimate population abundance and calf recruitment. We combined these data in an integrated population model to estimate female population growth, total population abundance, and recovery action effectiveness. Results suggest that the subpopulations were declining rapidly (λ = 0.90–0.93) before interventions and would have been functionally extirpated ({\textless}10 animals) within 10–15 years. Wolf reduction increased population growth rates by 0.12 for each subpopulation. Wolf reduction halted the decline of Quintette caribou and allowed them to increase (λ = 1.05), but alone would have only stabilized the Klinse-Za (λ = 1.02). However, maternity penning in the Klinse-Za increased population growth by a further 0.06, which when combined with wolf reductions, allowed populations to grow (λ = 1.08). Taken together, the recovery actions in these subpopulations increased adult female survival, calf recruitment, and overall population growth, more than doubling abundance. Our results suggest that maternity penning and wolf reductions can be effective at increasing caribou numbers in the short term, while long-term commitments to habitat protection and restoration are made.},

Integrated modeling approaches can improve estimation of demographic rates necessary for making predictions, even for rare or cryptic species with sparse data, but their use in management applications is limited. We developed integrated models for a population of diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) impacted by road-associated threats to (i) jointly estimate demographic rates from two mark-recapture datasets, while directly estimating road mortality and the impact of management actions deployed during the study; and (ii) project the population using population viability analysis under simulated management strategies to inform decision-making. Without management, population extirpation was nearly certain due to demographic impacts of road mortality, predators, and vegetation. Installation of novel flashing signage increased survival of terrapins that crossed roads by 30\%. Signage, along with small roadside barriers installed during the study, increased population persistence probability, but the population was still predicted to decline. Management strategies that included actions targeting multiple threats and demographic rates resulted in the highest persistence probability, and roadside barriers, which increased adult survival, were predicted to increase persistence more than other actions. Our results support earlier findings showing mitigation of multiple threats is likely required to increase the viability of declining populations. Our approach illustrates how integrated models may be adapted to use limited data efficiently, represent system complexity, evaluate impacts of threats and management actions, and provide decision-relevant information for conservation of at-risk populations.},

Populations possess structure, which may be defined as “fixed” stages through which individuals pass, with superimposed variability among individuals and groups. Data contain missing values and inaccurate censuses. From limited data ecologists attempt to predict life history schedules and population growth. We extend the “missing value” framework for Bayesian analysis of structured populations to admit the heterogeneity in demography and the limitations of data that are typical of ecological populations. Our hierarchical treatment of capture–recapture data allows inference on demographic rates contained in matrix transition models for populations that may be stratified by location and by other variables. Simulations with artificial data sets demonstrate the ability of the Bayesian model to successfully estimate underlying parameters, even with incomplete census data. In contrast, traditional nonhierarchical models may lead to biased parameter estimates because of variation in recapture rates of individuals. Analyses of published demographic data on Common Terns and Taitu Hills rats illustrate the utility of the model. Predictive distributions of maturation age, survivorship, and population growth demonstrate profound impacts of population and data complexity.},

	abstract = {To successfully respond to changing habitat, climate or harvest, managers need to identify the most effective strategies to reverse population trends of declining species and/or manage harvest of game species. A classic approach in conservation biology for the last two decades has been the use of matrix population models to determine the most important vital rates affecting population growth rate (λ), that is, sensitivity. Ecologists quickly realized the critical role of environmental variability in vital rates affecting λ by developing approaches such as life-stage simulation analysis (LSA) that account for both sensitivity and variability of a vital rate. These LSA methods used matrix-population modeling and Monte Carlo simulation methods, but faced challenges in integrating data from different sources, disentangling process and sampling variation, and in their flexibility. Here, we developed a Bayesian integrated population model (IPM) for two populations of a large herbivore, elk (Cervus canadensis) in Montana, USA. We then extended the IPM to evaluate sensitivity in a Bayesian framework. We integrated known-fate survival data from radio-marked adults and juveniles, fecundity data, and population counts in a hierarchical population model that explicitly accounted for process and sampling variance. Next, we tested the prevailing paradigm in large herbivore population ecology that juvenile survival of neonates {\textless}90 d old drives λ using our Bayesian LSA approach. In contrast to the prevailing paradigm in large herbivore ecology, we found that adult female survival explained more of the variation in λ than elk calf survival, and that summer and winter elk calf survival periods were nearly equivalent in importance for λ. Our Bayesian IPM improved precision of our vital rate estimates and highlighted discrepancies between count and vital rate data that could refine population monitoring, demonstrating that combining sensitivity analysis with population modeling in a Bayesian framework can provide multiple advantages. Our Bayesian LSA framework will provide a useful approach to addressing conservation challenges across a variety of species and data types.},

It is a short introductory guide to this popular form of decision making and is aimed at environmental managers and scientists. This is a distinctly pragmatic label given to ways for helping individuals and groups think through tough multidimensional choices characterized by uncertain science, diverse stakeholders, and difficult tradeoffs. This is the everyday reality of environmental management, yet many important decisions currently are made on an ad hoc basis that lacks a solid value-based foundation, ignores key information, and results in selection of an inferior alternative. Making progress – in a way that is rigorous, inclusive, defensible and transparent – requires combining analytical methods drawn from the decision sciences and applied ecology with deliberative insights from cognitive psychology, facilitation and negotiation. The authors review key methods and discuss case-study examples based in their experiences in communities, boardrooms, and stakeholder meetings. The goal of this book is to lay out a compelling guide that will change how you think about making environmental decisions.

	abstract = {Accurate and precise population estimates for the forest-dwelling ecotype of Woodland Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are very difficult to obtain because these Caribou are found at very low densities and in small herds dispersed over large areas. In order to suggest a standardized method, data from aerial surveys conducted in 1991 and 1993 (12 000 km2 blocks) were used to simulate various survey scenarios. Simulations showed that all the major groups of Caribou would have to be found and counted to obtain a confidence interval of ± 20\% (α = 0.10). We tested this technique in a survey carried out in winter 1999 in a 42 539 km2 study site, opting for a total coverage carried out in two phases. In phase one, we used an airplane, flying north-south transects spaced 2.1 km apart so as to detect most Caribou track networks. In phase two, a helicopter was used to count and determine the sex and age classes (calves/adults) of Caribou found in phase one. Using 20 radio-collared Caribou, the visibility rate of Caribou groups (phase one) and that of Caribou within the groups (phase two) were estimated at 0.90 and 0.94 respectively for an overall rate of 0.85 (SE = 0.08; α = 0.10). The corrected density was estimated at 1.6 Caribou per 100 km2 with a 15\% confidence interval (α = 0.10). The survey cost approximately \$4/km2, which is lower than that of two previous surveys (\$7/km2). Two main factors contributed to diminish costs: (1) the use of long-range airplanes (5-7 hours flying range) in phase one to minimize travel between the airports and the study site, and (2) the use of helicopters only in phase two for counting and determining the age and sex of the Caribou.Il est très difficile d’obtenir des estimations de population exactes et précises pour l’écotype forestier du Caribou des bois (Rangifer tarandus caribou) parce qu’on le retrouve en très faibles densités et qu’il est distribué en petites hardes réparties sur de vastes superficies. Les résultats de deux inventaires aériens réalisés en 1991 et 1993 (12 000 km2) ont été utilisés pour simuler divers scénarios d’inventaire afin de suggérer une méthode standardisée. Les simulations ont montré qu’il fallait trouver et recenser tous les groupes principaux pour obtenir un intervalle de confiance de ± 20 \% (α = 0,10). Nous avons testé cette approche dans un site d’étude de 42 539 km2 où nous avons opté pour un plan en deux phases. En phase un, l’avion a été utilisé pour couvrir totalement le site d’étude selon des virées équidistantes de 2,1 km afin de détecter la plupart des réseaux de pistes. L’hélicoptère fut utilisé en phase deux pour dénombrer et sexer les Caribous dans les réseaux de pistes détectés en phase un. D’après 20 Caribous munis de colliers émetteurs, le taux de visibilité global était de 0,85 (SE = 0,08; α = 0,10), soit 0,90 en phase 1 et 0,94 en phase 2. La densité corrigée était de 1,6 Caribou par 100 km2 avec une erreur relative de 15 \% (α = 0,10). L’inventaire a coûté 4 \$/km2, ce qui est inférieur aux montants investis lors des inventaires antérieurs (7 \$/km2). La diminution des coûts est attribuable à deux facteurs principaux : (1) l’utilisation d’avions à grand rayon d’action (5-7 heures d’autonomie) pour minimiser les déplacements en phase un; (2) l’emploi d’hélicoptères exclusivement pour le dénombrement et le sexage des caribous.},

Losses may be either accidental or controlled, the latter resulting from a decision to terminate certain observations. In either case it is usually assumed in this paper that the lifetime (age at death) is independent of the potential loss time; in practice this assumption deserves careful scrutiny. Despite the resulting incompleteness of the data, it is desired to estimate the proportion P(t) of items in the population whose lifetimes would exceed t (in the absence of such losses), without making any assumption about the form of the function P(t). The observation for each item of a suitable initial event, marking the beginning of its lifetime, is presupposed. For random samples of size N the product-limit (PL) estimate can be defined as follows: List and label the N observed lifetimes (whether to death or loss) in order of increasing magnitude, so that one has 0 ≤ t$_{\textrm{1}}$' ≤ t$_{\textrm{2}}$' ≤ ⋯ ≤ t$_{\textrm{N}}$'. Then {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}hat\{P\}(t) = {\textbackslash}prod\_r {\textbackslash}lbrack(N - r)/(N - r + 1){\textbackslash}rbrack\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}, where r assumes those values for which t$_{\textrm{r}}$' ≤ t and for which t$_{\textrm{r}}$' measures the time to death. This estimate is the distribution, unrestricted as to form, which maximizes the likelihood of the observations. Other estimates that are discussed are the actuarial estimates (which are also products, but with the number of factors usually reduced by grouping); and reduced-sample (RS) estimates, which require that losses not be accidental, so that the limits of observation (potential loss times) are known even for those items whose deaths are observed. When no losses occur at ages less than t, the estimate of P(t) in all cases reduces to the usual binomial estimate, namely, the observed proportion of survivors.},

Among ranges, mean annual survival of radiomarked adult females averaged 0.88 (range: 0.86-0.93). Predation by wolves (Canis lupus) and other predators was implicated as the most common cause of death for adult caribou in northeast Alberta. Pregnancy rates (90-100\%) and calf production (75-95\%) were relatively high in all caribou ranges; however, mean annual recruitment was near or below 20 calves per 100 cows in most ranges (x̄ = 17.1, range = 11.4-22.7). Caribou populations in 3 ranges have declined at average rates exceeding those that would lead to a 50\% decline from initial population size over 3 generations; another population is declining at half this rate. Populations of caribou in 2 ranges appear to be stable, declining marginally since inception of our study. The current distribution, intensity, amount, and type of human activity in and near caribou ranges is likely compromising the integrity of caribou habitat. Treatment of declines will require new land-use guidelines that promote caribou conservation.},

Historical data indicate that some local populations were eliminated and that the regional metapopulation declined during the 1970s. Proximate causes of decline may have included hunting, severe winter weather, and the end of predator control, though the ultimate causes may relate to road construction and logging activity, which expanded after 1966. There has been no sport hunting since 1987, yet the caribou populations in the region appear to be declining. Based on serum progesterone levels, first conception by females occurred at 16 months and the overall pregnancy rate was 94\%, and in addition the minimum parturition rate was 86\%, all of which indicate adequate nutrition. The annual survival rate of adults was 84\%, which is comparatively low, though similar to results from other studies on woodland caribou. We observed a low rate of calf recruitment (28 calves : 100 cows), which we suspect was due to predation. Wolves (Canis lupus) have long been thought to limit woodland caribou populations while subsisting on other ungulate prey, but we speculate that black bear (Ursus americanus) predation may be an important cause of poor calf survival.},

	abstract = {In forested ecosystems, estimating the abundance or trend of most wildlife populations is difficult. Therefore, vital rates are often used to model population change, but validating such models is important. Using data from woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus), we compared estimates of population change (λ) based on vital rate models to λ based on aerial censuses. We modeled λ using Hatter and Bergerud’s (1991) recruitment-mortality (R-M) equation (λ = survival/[1 – recruitment]). We estimated survival and recruitment from a sample of 317 radio-collared caribou from 9 subpopulations in British Columbia, Canada. In this ecosystem, woodland caribou have high sightability ({\textgreater}85\%) in winter and thus are easy to census compared to most forest wildlife. We found that the R-M equation overestimated λ compared to census-based λ across most of the observed range of data (e.g., if R-M estimated λ of 1.1, census-based λ was 0.99, and if R-M was 0.90, census-based λ was 0.89). We then assessed whether recruitment, survival, a linear model of both parameters, or the R-M equation best predicted census-based λ. The R-M equation explained 60\% of the variation in census-based λ, more than double the next-best approach (i.e., the simple linear model), even though identical parameters were included. Further, we simulated variability due to the unknown sex (M:F) ratio in the sample, and found that the R-M equation remained the best predictor of census-based λ. Although the R-M equation was the most precise and accurate approach, our results reaffirm that it is important to periodically validate trend estimates based on vital rate models with estimates of absolute abundance, particularly for species of management concern.},

	abstract = {Population monitoring is a critical part of effective wildlife management, but methods are prone to biases that can hinder our ability to accurately track changes in populations through time. Calf survival plays an important role in ungulate population dynamics and can be monitored using telemetry and herd composition surveys. These methods, however, are susceptible to unrepresentative sampling and violations of the assumption of equal detectability, respectively. Here, we capitalized on 55 herd-wide estimates of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) calf survival in Newfoundland, Canada, using telemetry (n = 1,175 calves) and 249 herd-wide estimates of calf:cow ratios (C:C) using herd composition surveys to investigate these potential biases. These data included 17 herd-wide estimates replicated from both methods concurrently (n = 448 calves and n = 17 surveys) which we used to understand which processes and sampling biases contributed to disagreement between estimates of herd-wide calf survival. We used Cox proportional hazards models to determine whether estimates of calf mortality risk were biased by the date a calf was collared. We also used linear mixed-effects models to determine whether estimates of C:C ratios were biased by survey date and herd size. We found that calves collared later in the calving season had a higher mortality risk and that C:C tended to be higher for surveys conducted later in the autumn. When we used these relationships to modify estimates of herd-wide calf survival derived from telemetry and herd composition surveys concurrently, we found that formerly disparate estimates of woodland caribou calf survival now overlapped (within a 95\% confidence interval) in a majority of cases. Our case study highlights the potential of under-appreciated biases to impact our understanding of population dynamics and suggests ways that managers can limit the influence of these biases in the two widely applied methods for estimating herd-wide survival.},

	abstract = {Most research on boreal populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) has been conducted in areas of high anthropogenic disturbance. However, a large portion of the species' range overlaps relatively pristine areas primarily affected by natural disturbances, such as wildfire. Climate-driven habitat change is a key concern for the conservation of boreal-dependent species, where management decisions have yet to consider knowledge from multiple ecological domains integrated into a cohesive and spatially explicit forecast of species-specific habitat and demography. We used a novel ecological forecasting framework to provide climate-sensitive projections of habitat and demography for five boreal caribou monitoring areas within the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, over 90 years. Importantly, we quantify uncertainty around forecasted mean values. Our results suggest habitat suitability may increase in central and southwest regions of the NWT's Taiga Plains ecozone but decrease in southern and northwestern regions driven by conversion of coniferous to deciduous forests. We do not project that boreal caribou population growth rates will change despite forecasted changes to habitat suitability. Our results emphasize the importance of efforts to protect and restore northern boreal caribou habitat despite climate uncertainty while highlighting expected spatial variations that are important considerations for local people who rely on them. An ability to reproduce previous work, and critical thought when incorporating sources of uncertainty, will be important to refine forecasts, derive management decisions, and improve conservation efficacy for northern species at risk.},

The objective of this study was to do an assessment of three endangered caribou subpopulations using non-invasive genetic sampling to assess demographic population changes by combining capture-recapture modeling, familial pedigree networks, individual fitness and inbreeding coefficients. Three subpopulations of the Central Mountain caribou ecotype (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in Jasper National Park, Canada, were systematically surveyed over a 10-year period and fecal samples collected for DNA analyses. For the Tonquin, population size declined at a rate of 0.86 (95\% CI 0.82, 0.91), the number of females decreased from 41 in 2006 to only 14 in 2015. The Brazeau and Maligne subpopulations also declined over the same period, from 22 to 11 individuals (11 and 5 females) in 2006, to 12 and 3 individuals (6 and 1 females) in 2015. The pedigree network confirmed limited interbreeding among subpopulations, varied fitness levels in both males and females, and evidence of inbreeding avoidance among high-fitness individuals. All population parameters pointed to a rapid population decline and low population sizes, putting them at high risk of extinction. The varying reproductive fitness observed amongst males and females was significant and should be considered in future population augmentation or reintroduction efforts. Improved connectivity among and with neighbouring subpopulations should also be considered to sustain or enhance genetic diversity.},

	abstract = {A critical step in recovery efforts for endangered and threatened species is the monitoring of population demographic parameters. As part of these efforts, we evaluated the use of fecal-DNA based capture–recapture methods to estimate population sizes and population rate of change for the North Interlake woodland caribou herd (Rangifer tarandus caribou), Manitoba, Canada. This herd is part of the boreal population of woodland caribou, listed as threatened under the federal Species at Risk Act (2003) and the provincial Manitoba Endangered Species Act (2006). Between 2004 and 2009 (9 surveys), we collected 1,080 fecal samples and identified 180 unique genotypes (102 females and 78 males). We used a robust design survey plan with 2 surveys in most years and analysed the data with Program MARK to estimate encounter rates (p), apparent survival rates (φ), rates of population change (λ), and population sizes (N). We estimated these demographic parameters for males and females and for 2 genetic clusters within the North Interlake. The population size estimates were larger for the Lower than the Upper North Interlake area and the proportion of males was lower in the Lower (33\%) than the Upper North Interlake (49\%). Population rate of change for the entire North Interlake area (2005–2009) using the robust design Pradel model was significantly {\textless}1.0 (λ = 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.82–0.99) and varied between sex and area with the highest being for males in Lower North Interlake (λ = 0.98, 95\% CI: 0.83–1.13) and the lowest being for females in Upper North Interlake (λ = 0.83, 95\% CI: 0.69–0.97). The additivity of λ between sex and area is supported on the log scale and translates into males having a λ that is 0.09 greater than females and independent of sex, Lower North Interlake having a λ that is 0.06 greater than Upper North Interlake. Population estimates paralleled these declining trends, which correspond to trends observed in other fragmented populations of woodland caribou along the southern part of their range.

	abstract = {Understanding how individuals within populations are connected genetically and through shared space-use is critical to understanding the demographic patterns of at-risk populations. In recent years, non-invasive genetic sampling methods have allowed us to begin addressing these questions. Using a network analysis framework, we examined the spatial co-occurrence and genetic relatedness of boreal and central mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus) in populations varying in sizes and trend from across western Canada. Using 15 microsatellites loci and a sex-specific marker, we developed pedigree networks for each population, including first to third order relationships. We constructed networks of individual spatial co-occurrence, and using multilayer network analysis, we determined the degree to which caribou that co-occurred spatially were related. Caribou populations varied in the extent and classes of familial relationships which co-occurred in space. In most populations, spatial co-occurrences were greater than expected only for parent-offspring relationships. A sex-specific analysis of the longest sampled population revealed that this was driven by a significant overlap between mothers and their offspring. Whereas in populations where very few parent-offspring relationship were detected, no significant overlap was found between any relationship categories. The lack of overlap in these populations may be an indication of poor calf survival. On the other hand, the higher degree of overlap with more distant relations (i.e., grandparents) seen in some populations may indicate a population that lacks mobility. Our research presents a new approach to explore both spatial and genetic overlap at the individual level in support of the conservation of threatened populations.},

However, individual variation is not normally considered in population viability analysis, potentially leading to misleading projections for small populations. We present a novel data-augmentation approach for incorporating individual variation in rates in integrated population models. By adding rows to survival and reproduction matrices for hypothetical individuals in both the past and future, inferences about individual variation derived from Bayesian hierarchical modelling are propagated into population projections. We apply this method to a small reintroduced population of hihi (Notiomystis cincta) at Bushy Park, New Zealand, where individuals vary greatly in reproductive success, longevity and detection probability, and ongoing management decisions depend on modelling projections. We compare the results to those from an alternative model that ignores individual variation but incorporates sex and age effects. The modelling confirmed pronounced individual variation in all rates, and greatly altered their interpretation. Estimated survival and reproduction rates of average individuals became much lower and apparent age effects disappeared. In addition, the estimated proportion of fledglings produced by unmonitored females dropped from 23\% to 9\%. Incorporation of individual variation in the integrated population model resulted in more optimistic population projections over the next four years although the difference was minor in relation to the 95\% prediction limits. The methodology presented has broad potential for assessing whether population projections used to guide management of small populations are sensitive to individual variation.},

	abstract = {A central assumption underlying the study of habitat selection is that selected habitats confer enhanced fitness. Unfortunately, this assumption is rarely tested, and in some systems, gradients of predation risk may more accurately characterize spatial variation in vital rates than gradients described by habitat selection studies. Here, we separately measured spatial patterns of both resource selection and predation risk and tested their relationships with a key demographic trait, adult female survival, for a threatened ungulate, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou Gmelin). We also evaluated whether exposure to gradients in both predation risk and resource selection value was manifested temporally through instantaneous or seasonal effects on survival outcomes. We used Cox proportional hazards spatial survival modelling to assess the relative support for 5 selection- and risk-based definitions of habitat quality, as quantified by woodland caribou adult female survival. These hypotheses included scenarios in which selection ideally mirrored survival, risk entirely drove survival, non-ideal selection correlated with survival but with additive risk effects, an ecological trap with maladaptive selection and a non-spatial effect of annual variation in weather. Indeed, we found positive relationships between the predicted values of a resource selection function (RSF) and survival, yet subsequently incorporating an additional negative effect of predation risk greatly improved models further. This revealed a positive, but non-ideal relationship between selection and survival. Gradients in these covariates were also shown to affect individual survival probability at multiple temporal scales. Exposure to increased predation risk had a relatively instantaneous effect on survival outcomes, whereas variation in habitat suitability predicted by an RSF had both instantaneous and longer-term seasonal effects on survival. Predation risk was an additive source of hazard beyond that detected through selection alone, and woodland caribou selection thus was shown to be non-ideal. Furthermore, by combining spatial adult female survival models with herd-specific estimates of recruitment in matrix population models, we estimated a spatially explicit landscape of population growth predictions for this endangered species.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Knowing where species occur is fundamental to many ecological and environmental applications. Species distribution models (SDMs) are typically based on correlations between species occurrence data and environmental predictors, with ecological processes captured only implicitly. However, there is a growing interest in approaches that explicitly model processes such as physiology, dispersal, demography and biotic interactions. These models are believed to offer more robust predictions, particularly when extrapolating to novel conditions. Many process–explicit approaches are now available, but it is not clear how we can best draw on this expanded modelling toolbox to address ecological problems and inform management decisions. Here, we review a range of process–explicit models to determine their strengths and limitations, as well as their current use. Focusing on four common applications of SDMs – regulatory planning, extinction risk, climate refugia and invasive species – we then explore which models best meet management needs. We identify barriers to more widespread and effective use of process‐explicit models and outline how these might be overcome. As well as technical and data challenges, there is a pressing need for more thorough evaluation of model predictions to guide investment in method development and ensure the promise of these new approaches is fully realised.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Aim: Species distribution modelling (SDM) is commonly used to predict spatial patterns of biodiversity across sets of taxa with sufficient distributional records, while omitting narrow-ranging species due to statistical constraints. We investigate the implications of this dichotomy for conservation priority setting in Africa, now and in the future. Location: Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding islands). Methods: We use multivariate ordination to characterize climatic niches of 733 African amphibians, distinguishing between species eligible for large-scale correlative SDM (≥ 10 records at 1° resolution) and those omitted due to insufficient records. Species distributions are projected under current and future climates using simple niche envelopes. Empirical priorities are derived separately on the eligible and omitted sets and compared with three existing large-scale conservation schemes. Results: Of the 733 amphibian species, 400 have too few records for correlative SDM, including 92\% of those threatened with extinction (VU/EN/CR). Omitted species typically occupy topographically complex areas with cooler, wetter and less seasonal climates, which are projected to experience lower rates of climatic change. Priorities derived from omitted species have greater congruence with existing conservation schemes. Under future climate, priorities for eligible species shift towards those for omitted species. Similarly, while omitted species often lose climate space at 1° resolution, persistent populations tend to coincide with existing conservation schemes. Main conclusions: Under current climate, statistical restrictions on SDM systematically downplay important sites for narrow-ranging and threatened species. This issue spans taxonomic groups and is only partially mitigated by modelling at finer scales. Effective biodiversity conservation, now and in the future, relies on our capacity to project geographic determinants of all species, and thus, a wider range of approaches is essential. We conclude, however, that future persistence among narrow- and wide-ranging species alike will be highest within sites already identified for conservation investment and that the focus on these sites ought to be maintained.},

	abstract = {The MaxEnt software package is one of the most popular tools for species distribution and environmental niche modeling, with over 1000 published applications since 2006. Its popularity is likely for two reasons: 1) MaxEnt typically outperforms other methods based on predictive accuracy and 2) the software is particularly easy to use. MaxEnt users must make a number of decisions about how they should select their input data and choose from a wide variety of settings in the software package to build models from these data. The underlying basis for making these decisions is unclear in many studies, and default settings are apparently chosen, even though alternative settings are often more appropriate. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how MaxEnt works and a prospectus on modeling options to enable users to make informed decisions when preparing data, choosing settings and interpreting output. We explain how the choice of background samples reflects prior assumptions, how nonlinear functions of environmental variables (features) are created and selected, how to account for environmentally biased sampling, the interpretation of the various types of model output and the challenges for model evaluation. We demonstrate MaxEnt's calculations using both simplified simulated data and occurrence data from South Africa on species of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Throughout, we show how MaxEnt's outputs vary in response to different settings to highlight the need for making biologically motivated modeling decisions. © 2013 The Authors.},

	abstract = {In a previous analysis, six major threats to at-risk species in Canada were quantified: habitat loss, introduced species, over-exploitation, pollution, native species interactions, and natural causes (O. Venter et al. 2006. Bioscience, 56(11): 903–910). Because of rapid environmental change in Canada and an enhanced understanding of the drivers of species endangerment, we updated the 2005 analysis and tested for changes in threats up until the end of 2018. We also expanded the scope to acknowledge climate change as a seventh major threat to species, given its increasing importance for reshaping biological communities. Using information on the COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) website, we scored the threats for each of 814 species. Habitat loss remained the most important anthropogenic threat to Canada’s at-risk species, affecting 82\% of species, followed by over-exploitation (47\%), introduced species (46\%), and pollution (35\%). Climate change was the least important threat, affecting only 13\% of species. However, report writers used less certain language when talking about climate change compared with other threats, so when we included cases where climate change was listed as a probable or future cause, climate change was the fourth most important anthropogenic threat, affecting some 38\% of species. The prevalence of threat categories was broadly similar to those for the United States and IUCN listed species. The taxa most affected by climate change included lichens (77\%), birds (63\%), marine mammals (60\%), and Arctic species of all taxa (79\%), whereas vascular plants (23\%), marine fishes (24\%), arthropods (27\%), and non-Arctic species (35\%) were least affected. A paired analysis of the 188 species with two or more reports indicated that any mention of climate change as a threat increased from 12\% to 50\% in 10 years. Other anthropogenic threats that have increased significantly over time in the paired analysis included introduced species, over-exploitation, and pollution. Our analysis suggests that threats are changing rapidly over time, emphasizing the need to monitor future trends of all threats, including climate change.},

	abstract = {Criticism has been levelled at climate-change-induced forecasts of species range shifts that do not account explicitly for complex population dynamics. The relative importance of such dynamics under climate change is, however, undetermined because direct tests comparing the performance of demographic models vs. simpler ecological niche models are still lacking owing to difficulties in evaluating forecasts using real-world data. We provide the first comparison of the skill of coupled ecological-niche-population models and ecological niche models in predicting documented shifts in the ranges of 20 British breeding bird species across a 40-year period. Forecasts from models calibrated with data centred on 1970 were evaluated using data centred on 2010. We found that more complex coupled ecological-niche-population models (that account for dispersal and metapopulation dynamics) tend to have higher predictive accuracy in forecasting species range shifts than structurally simpler models that only account for variation in climate. However, these better forecasts are achieved only if ecological responses to climate change are simulated without static snapshots of historic land use, taken at a single point in time. In contrast, including both static land use and dynamic climate variables in simpler ecological niche models improve forecasts of observed range shifts. Despite being less skilful at predicting range changes at the grid-cell level, ecological niche models do as well, or better, than more complex models at predicting the magnitude of relative change in range size. Therefore, ecological niche models can provide a reasonable first approximation of the magnitude of species' potential range shifts, especially when more detailed data are lacking on dispersal dynamics, demographic processes underpinning population performance, and change in land cover.},

Understanding how populations will change in response to these drivers is fundamental to a wide range of ecological applications, but there are few open-source software options accessible to researchers and managers that allow them to predict these changes in a flexible and transparent way. We introduce an open-source, multi-platform r package, steps, that models spatial changes in species populations as a function of drivers of distribution and abundance, such as climate, disturbance, landscape dynamics and species ecological and physiological requirements. To illustrate the functionality of steps, we model the population dynamics of the greater glider Petauroides volans, an arboreal Australian mammal. We demonstrate how steps can be used to simulate population responses of the glider to forest dynamics and management with the types of data commonly used in ecological analyses. steps expands on the features found in existing software packages, can easily incorporate a range of spatial layers (e.g. habitat suitability, vegetation dynamics and disturbances), facilitates integrated and transparent analyses within a single platform and produces interpretable outputs of changes in species' populations through space and time. Further, steps offers both ready-to-use, built-in functionality, as well as the ability for advanced users to define their own modules for custom analyses. Thus, we anticipate that steps will be of significant value to environment and wildlife managers and researchers from a broad range of disciplines.},

Species distribution models (SDMs) coupled with population dynamics models can incorporate relationships between changing environments and demographics and are increasingly used to quantify relative extinction risks associated with climate and land-use changes. Despite their appeal, uncertainties associated with complex models can undermine their usefulness for advancing predictive ecology and informing conservation management decisions. We developed a computationallyefficient and freely available tool (GRIP 2.0) that implements and automates a global sensitivity analysis of coupled SDM-population dynamics models for comparing the relative influence of demographic parameters and habitat attributes on predicted extinction risk. Advances over previous global sensitivity analyses include the ability to vary habitat suitability across gradients, as well as habitat amount and configuration of spatially-explicit suitability maps of real and simulated landscapes. Using GRIP 2.0, we carried out a multi-model global sensitivity analysis of a coupled SDM-population dynamics model of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) in Mount Rainier National Park as a case study and quantified the relative influence of input parameters and their interactions on model predictions. Our results differed from the one-at-time analyses used in the original study, and we found that the most influential parameters included the total amount of suitable habitat within the landscape, survival rates, and effects of a prevalent disease, white pine blister rust. Strong interactions between habitat amount and survival rates of older trees suggests the importance of habitat in mediating the negative influences of white pine blister rust. Our results underscore the importance of considering habitat attributes along with demographic parameters in sensitivity routines. GRIP 2.0 is an important decision-support tool that can be used to prioritize research, identify habitat-based thresholds and management intervention points to improve probability of species persistence, and evaluate trade-offs of alternative management options.},

Observations of honey bees returning to their hives at high ambient temperatures support the conjecture that honey bees regulate head and thorax temperatures at high T a by regurgitating droplets of honey stomach contents which are then evaporated. The proportion of returning bees with a droplet on the tongue increased with increasing shade temperature (T s), from essentially no bees at 20 °C to 40\% of returning bees at 40 °C. Pollen foragers carry relatively little fluid during the hottest periods, and pollen foraging decreased at high ambient temperatures. Thoracic temperatures of pollen collectors are significantly higher than thoracic temperatures of water and nectar gatherers at 40°C (46-13 vs 44°C). Additionally, water and nectar foragers with extruded droplets have slightly cooler heads and thoraces (38-94 and 43-22°C) than bees not extruding droplets (40-28 and 44-18°C). Wing-loading and thoracic temperatures of bees are inversely correlated at high ambient temperatures (35 °C) and this is probably caused by a higher propensity of heavier bees to extrude fluid, thus reducing thoracic temperature .},

The local application of regionally parameterized yield curves may also be at fault. It is unlikely that long-term trends in climate or atmospheric composition may have generated such bias.

On the other hand, continuous maps of forest attributes are required to support strategic analyses of regional policy and management issues. We have therefore produced maps covering 4.03 × 10 $^{\textrm{6}}$ km $^{\textrm{2}}$ of inventoried forest area for the 2001 base year using standardised observations from the NFI photo plots (PP) as reference data. We used the k nearest neighbours (kNN) method with 26 geospatial data layers including MODIS spectral data and climatic and topographic variables to produce maps of 127 forest attributes at a 250 × 250 m resolution. The stand-level attributes include land cover, structure, and tree species relative abundance. In this article, we report only on total live aboveground tree biomass, with all other attributes covered in the supplementary data ( http://nrcresearchpress.com/doi/suppl/10.1139/cjfr-2013-0401 ). In general, deviations in predicted pixel-level values from those in a PP validation set are greater in mountainous regions and in areas with either low biomass or sparse PP sampling. Predicted pixel-level values are overestimated at small observed values and underestimated at large ones. Accuracy measures are improved through the spatial aggregation of pixels to 1 km $^{\textrm{2}}$ and beyond. Overall, these new products provide unique baseline information for strategic-level analyses of forests ( https://nfi.nfis.org ). {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The generation of geospatial thematic information for managing and monitoring Canada's boreal ecosystem is essential for researchers, land managers, and policy makers. Canada's boreal region is a vast mosaic of forests, wetlands, rivers, and lakes, but anthropogenic disturbances have impacted these ecosystems resulting in habitat loss, fragmentation, and threats to biodiversity. Across Canada various geospatial datasets representing anthropogenic disturbance exist for timber harvesting, hydroelectric activity, settlement, and oil and gas activities; however, these products often vary in scale, attributes, time period, and mapping technique. Driven by the need for national data as part of the 2011 boreal caribou science assessment, a standardized methodology was developed and implemented to create a single geospatial dataset representing anthropogenic disturbances across a significant portion of Canada's boreal ecosystem. The boreal ecosystem anthropogenic disturbances data are a vector disturbance dataset of individual linear and polygonal disturbance types that were manually collected through the interpretation of 2008Á2010 Landsat imagery at a 1:50 000 viewing scale. Summary results identified a total polygonal anthropogenic disturbance footprint of approximately 24 million ha with forest cutblocks accounting for more than 60\% of mapped polygonal disturbance. Linear disturbance features across the boreal total approximately 600 000 km with roads and seismic exploration lines contributing to more than 80\% of the mapped linear disturbances. Résumé. La génération d'information géospatiale et thématique pour la gestion et le suivi de l'e ´cosystème boréal du Canada est essentielle pour les chercheurs, les gestionnaires des terres et les décideurs. La zone boréale du Canada est une vaste mosaı¨quemosaı¨que composée de forêts, de milieux humides et de rivières et de lacs, mais les perturbations anthropiques ont eu des impacts sur ces e ´cosystèmes qui ont engendré la perte et la fragmentation d'habitats, tout en menaçant la biodiversité. Pour l'ensemble du Canada, il existe divers ensembles de données géospatiales représentant les perturbations anthropiques engendrées par les coupes forestières, les activités hydroélectriques, le peuplement ainsi que les activités pétrolières et gazières. Cependant, ces produits varient en termes d'e ´chelle, d'attributs, de période temporelle et de technique cartographique. En réponse au besoin exprimé pour des données nationales dans le contexte de l'E ´ valuation scientifique de l'habitat essentiel du caribou boréal 2011, une méthodologie standardisée a e ´té développée et mise en place pour créer un ensemble unique de données géospatiales représentant les perturbations anthropiques pour une portion significative de l'e ´cosystème boréal du Canada. Les données des perturbations anthropiques de l'e ´cosystème boréal sont un ensemble de données vectorielles des perturbations observées en fonction des divers types d'entités linéaires individuelles et polygonales de perturbations qui ont e ´té collectées manuellement par le biais de l'interprétation d'images Landsat a ` l'e ´chelle de 1 : 50 000 de 2008 a ` 2010. Les résultats sommaires ont permis d'identifier une empreinte totale de polygones de perturbations anthropiques e ´quivalente a ` approximativement 24 millions d'hectares, les parterres de coupe représentant plus de 60 \% des polygones de perturbations cartographiés. Les perturbations linéaires pour l'ensemble de la zone boréale représentent approximativement 600 000 km, les routes et les lignes d'exploration sismique comptant pour plus de 80 \% des perturbations linéaires cartographiées.

	abstract = {Context: Forest landscapes at the southern boreal forest transition zone are likely to undergo great alterations due to projected changes in regional climate. Objectives: We projected changes in forest landscapes resulting from four climate scenarios (baseline, RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), by simulating changes in tree growth and disturbances at the southern edge of Canada’s boreal zone. Methods: Projections were performed for four regions located on an east–west gradient using a forest landscape model (LANDIS-II) parameterized using a forest patch model (PICUS). Results: Climate-induced changes in the competitiveness of dominant tree species due to changes in potential growth, and substantial intensification of the fire regime, appear likely to combine in driving major changes in boreal forest landscapes. Resulting cumulative impacts on forest ecosystems would be manifold but key changes would include (i) a strong decrease in the biomass of the dominant boreal species, especially mid- to late-successional conifers; (ii) increases in abundance of some temperate species able to colonize disturbed areas in a warmer climate; (iii) increases in the proportions of pioneer and fire-adapted species in these landscapes and (iv) an overall decrease in productivity and total biomass. The greatest changes would occur under the RCP 8.5 radiative forcing scenario, but some impacts can be expected even with RCP 2.6. Conclusions: Western boreal forests, i.e., those bordering the prairies, are the most vulnerable because of a lack of species adapted to warmer climates and major increases in areas burned. Conservation and forest management planning within the southern boreal transition zone should consider both disturbance- and climate-induced changes in forest communities.},

	abstract = {In an effort to ensure the sustainability of their forests, boreal forest managers often use forest planning models to make future projections of timber supply and other key services, such as habitat for wildlife. Projecting the fate of these services has proven to be challenging, however, as major uncertainties exist regarding the principal drivers of boreal ecosystem dynamics, including the future spatial and temporal distribution of wildfire and timber harvesting. Existing forest planning models are not well suited to dealing with this uncertainty because they produce deterministic projections based on central tendencies of these drivers. Here we present a new approach for incorporating uncertainty into forest management planning, which we demonstrate using two landscapes in the Canadian boreal forest. Our approach takes the assumptions contained within the latest forest management plans for each of these landscapes, including parameterizations of their deterministic forest planning models, and converts these assumptions into equivalent parameterizations of a stochastic, spatially-explicit state-and-transition simulation model (STSM). We then use Monte Carlo simulations with the STSM to “stress-test” the forest management plan with respect to a range of possible future uncertainties, including uncertainties in future levels and patterns of wildfire and timber harvest, along with the possible changes in wildfire that might result from future climate change. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of incorporating stochastic variability into projections of future ecosystem condition. The STSM projections that acknowledged variability in wildfire and timber harvest differed from the deterministic forest planning model projections that were based solely on mean values. Our analysis also suggests that there is an increased risk of shortfalls in timber harvest, for both boreal landscapes, associated with future projections for changes in wildfire due to climate change, and that management strategies aimed at reducing the future level of timber harvest offer an opportunity to mitigate these risks. We believe our approach provides a new risk-based framework for incorporating uncertainty into forest management, including the effects of climate change.},

Comparison of predicted increments in plot-level height, basal area and merchantable wood volume to increments of these variables measured in permanent sample plots shows a moderate to poor predictive ability. Comparison with the performance of four operational growth and yield models from different provinces across Canada shows comparable predictive power of this new model versus that of the provincial models. Based on these results, we suggest that the simplification of regional growth and yield models may be achieved without further loss of predictive power, and that the large error in the prediction of growth increment is mostly associated with the use of temporary sample plots which, by definition, contain little information on stand dynamics. We also suggest that, because of the empirical nature of these growth and yield models, the scale of application should determine the appropriate scale of the model. National estimates of forest growth are therefore less likely to be biased if obtained from a national model only than if obtained from a combination of regional models, where those exist, gap-filled with estimates from a national model.},

To link these widely scaled processes, we used biomass (living and dead) as an integrating variable that provides feedbacks between disturbance and ecosystem processes and feedbacks among multiple disturbances. We integrated a simple model of biomass growth, mortality, and decay into LANDIS, a spatially dynamic landscape simulation model. The new biomass module was statically linked to PnET-II, a generalized ecosystem process model. The combined model simulates disturbances (fire, wind, harvesting), dispersal, forest biomass growth and mortality, and inter-and intra-specific competition. We used the model to quantify how fire and windthrow alter forest succession, living biomass and dead biomass across an artificial landscape representative of northern Wisconsin, USA.

	abstract = {Fire activity in North American forests is expected to increase substantially with climate change. This would represent a growing risk to human settlements and industrial infrastructure proximal to forests, and to the forest products industry. We modelled fire size distributions in southern Qué bec as functions of fire weather and land cover, thus explicitly integrating some of the biotic interactions and feedbacks in a forest-wildfire system. We found that, contrary to expectations, land-cover and not fire weather was the primary driver of fire size in our study region. Fires were highly selective on fuel-type under a wide range of fire weather conditions: specifically, deciduous forest, lakes and to a lesser extent recently burned areas decreased the expected fire size in their vicinity compared to conifer forest. This has large implications for fire risk management in that fuels management could reduce fire risk over the long term. Our results imply, for example, that if 30\% of a conifer-dominated landscape were converted to hardwoods, the probability of a given fire, occurring in that landscape under mean fire weather conditions, exceeding 100,000 ha would be reduced by a factor of 21. A similarly marked but slightly smaller effect size would be expected under extreme fire weather conditions. We attribute the decrease in expected fire size that occurs in recently burned areas to fuel availability limitations on fires spread. Because regenerating burned conifer stands often pass through a deciduous stage, this would also act as a negative biotic feedback whereby the occurrence of fires limits the size of nearby future for some period of time. Our parameter estimates imply that changes in vegetation flammability or fuel availability after fires would tend to counteract shifts in the fire size distribution favoring larger fires that are expected under climate warming. Ecological forecasts from models neglecting these feedbacks may markedly overestimate the consequences of climate warming on fire activity, and could be misleading. Assessments of vulnerability to climate change, and subsequent adaptation strategies, are directly dependent on integrated ecological forecasts. Thus, we stress the need to explicitly incorporate land-cover's direct effects and feed-backs in simulation models of coupled climate-fire-fuels systems.

We evaluated five a priori hypotheses describing seasonal habitat selection of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) across three regions in northern Ontario. Two regions were Boreal Shield dominated, one area with relatively high anthropogenic disturbance (due to commercial forestry) and the other with relatively low anthropogenic disturbance. The final region was located on the wetland-dominated Hudson Bay Lowlands. Each region encompassed two caribou management ranges: one was used for model development and the other for model evaluation. We developed seasonal resource selection probability functions using seasonal utilization distributions and isopleths derived from GPS collar data (from 212 caribou) to identify high- and low-use areas. We explored selection across five spatial scales; selection patterns were strongest at the 10 000 ha scale. We found temporal and spatial variations in all environmental predictors across ranges and seasons, especially in the Hudson Bay Lowlands. Our results consistently supported the integrated global model (with common variables but range-specific coefficients) where caribou habitat use is related to minimizing apparent competition with moose (Alces alces (L., 1758)) while avoiding disturbed areas, and utilizing areas with adequate forage.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Our approach uses a hybrid model, combining habitat suitability and the presence of the invasive in neighbouring cells to predict the probability of a cell being invaded over time. A generalized linear mixed-effects model was used to create a habitat suitability model and a spread model. The habitat suitability model predicts the presence of buckthorn based on environmental characteristics and the results are used in the spread model. The spread model indicates that the invasion of buckthorn is influenced by the suitability of habitat and the presence of buckthorn in neighbouring cells. The success of the spread model suggests that this approach can be used to create a spatiotemporally explicit model with limited sampling effort.},

	abstract = {© 2018 Wind is an important driver of forest dynamics in eastern Canada, but knowledge of variables that predispose forest stands to windthrow remains unclear. This is of particular concern as climate change is expected to alter the frequency of strong wind events that affect eastern Canada. In this study, we used widescale forest survey data from Nova Scotia, Canada, of wind damage caused by Hurricane Juan, to investigate variables that influence stand vulnerability to windthrow. Juan made landfall as a category SS2 hurricane with sustained winds of 158 km/h and damaged over 600,000 ha of forest. The damage zone was surveyed using aerial photography and satellite imagery, delineated according to level of wind damage, and digitized as a 15 × 15 m resolution spatial raster layer. We selected a random sample of 50,000 cells classified as intact forest and 50,000 cells classified as stand-replacing windthrow from the raster layer and used boosted regression tree analysis to explore the influence of various meteorological, topographic, soil, and forest structural variables on the occurrence of windthrow. Wind speed and forest structure, specifically stand height and species composition, were most influential in determining windthrow. Sustained winds of at least 95 km/h or gusts of 130 km/h caused {\textgreater}50\% probability of windthrow. Taller stands were most vulnerable, especially those dominated by spruce (Picea spp.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea), whereas higher hardwood and pine abundance reduced windthrow. Interestingly, topographical exposure (Topex) ranked low in overall influence; however, a clear relationship between increased exposure and windthrow was observed.},

	abstract = {© 2020 Predicting forest succession is not a trivial pursuit and has remained a central challenge for scientists and foresters for well over a century. While thousands of papers have been published on the topic, contributing to a plethora of concepts and terminologies, there remains confusion over causal mechanisms, inhibiting our ability to adopt many lessons learned to sustainable forest management. Based on an emerging conceptual model of forest succession, presented here as the “Succession Triangle”, we sought to explore the relative importance of mechanisms hypothesized to drive succession following commercial harvesting across a wide landscape in the Acadian Forest Region of eastern Canada. Using machine learning techniques and repeatedly measured forest stand inventory data, including 19,332 forest stands measured over a ≈30 year period, we uncovered dominant early succession pathways and investigated key mechanisms driving these pathways. Overall, our results show stands may follow multiple succession pathways following harvesting, including early dominance by so-called “late-succession” species (e.g., black spruce and sugar maple), depending on causal mechanisms. More specifically, mechanisms related to the state of the environment (primarily climate) and differential species availability (mainly pre- and post-harvest overstorey composition) had the strongest control over early succession. The strong influence of pre-harvest composition on early succession supports the ‘direct regeneration’ hypothesis; while the importance of post-harvest overstorey composition suggests the use of partial-cutting as a means of regenerating shade-tolerant species (e.g., sugar maple and red spruce). Site conditions (i.e., slope and drainage) influenced the direction of succession, but landscape-level variation in climate had the overall strongest effect, with colder, more moist climates promoting regeneration of balsam fir, while warmer, dryer climates encouraged shade-intolerant, broadleaf species (birches, red maple and poplars), especially following clear-cutting. Given the strong influence of climate, we used our fitted model to predict the impact of late 21st century climate change on early succession using the “business-as-usual” RCP 8.5 radiative forcing scenario. Our results indicate climate change is likely to increase the regeneration of shade-intolerant, broadleaf tree species (e.g., red maple and poplars) across the landscape at the loss of cold-adapted balsam fir, supporting the hypothesis that young, post-harvest stands are vulnerable to climate-driven shifts in composition as postulated by ‘resilience theory’, and corroborating previous simulation studies that predict rapid 21st century climate warming will lead to ‘deborealization’ of Canada's Acadian Forest Region.},

	abstract = {Univariate and multivariate methods are commonly used to explore the spatial and temporal dynamics of ecological communities, but each has limitations, including oversimplification or abstraction of communities. Rank abundance curves (RACs) potentially integrate these existing methodologies by detailing species-level community changes. Here, we had three goals: first, to simplify analysis of community dynamics by developing a coordinated set of R functions, and second, to demystify the relationships among univariate, multivariate, and RACs measures, and examine how each is influenced by the community parameters as well as data collection methods. We developed new functions for studying temporal changes and spatial differences in RACs in an update to the R package library(“codyn”), alongside other new functions to calculate univariate and multivariate measures of community dynamics. We also developed a new approach to studying changes in the shape of RAC curves. The R package update presented here increases the accessibility of univariate and multivariate measures of community change over time and difference over space. Next, we use simulated and real data to assess the RAC and multivariate measures that are output from our new functions, studying (1) if they are influenced by species richness and evenness, temporal turnover, and spatial variability and (2) how the measures are related to each other. Lastly, we explore the use of the measures with an example from a long-term nutrient addition experiment. We find that the RAC and multivariate measures are not sensitive to species richness and evenness and that all the measures detail unique aspects of temporal change or spatial differences. We also find that species reordering is the strongest correlate of a multivariate measure of compositional change and explains most community change observed in long-term nutrient addition experiment. Overall, we show that species reordering is potentially an understudied determinant of community changes over time or differences between treatments. The functions developed here should enhance the use of RACs to further explore the dynamics of ecological communities.},

We synthesized publicly available data to estimate and interpret trends in neonicotinoid use since their introduction in 1994, with a special focus on seed treatments, a major use not captured by the national pesticide-use survey. Neonicotinoid use increased rapidly between 2003 and 2011, as seed-applied products were introduced in field crops, marking an unprecedented shift toward large-scale, preemptive insecticide use: 34-44\% of soybeans and 79-100\% of maize hectares were treated in 2011. This finding contradicts recent analyses, which concluded that insecticides are used today on fewer maize hectares than a decade or two ago. If current trends continue, neonicotinoid use will increase further through application to more hectares of soybean and other crop species and escalation of per-seed rates. Alternatively, our results, and other recent analyses, suggest that carefully targeted efforts could considerably reduce neonicotinoid use in field crops without yield declines or economic harm to farmers, reducing the potential for pest resistance, nontarget pest outbreaks, environmental contamination, and harm to wildlife, including pollinator species.},

Four major metabolites can be detected, in variable concentrations, among which the hydroxy- and olefin-imidacloprid have toxicities equivalent to that of imidacloprid. In pollen, concentrations of imidacloprid were 13 ng·g -1.

Here, we develop a framework based on community dynamics and propose a new temporal turnover measure. A simulation study and an analysis of an estuarine fish community both clearly demonstrate that our proposed turnover measure offers additional insights relative to spatial context-based metrics.

	abstract = {Recently, gaining knowledge about thermal refuges for vulnerable species has been a major focal point of ecological studies, and this focus has been heightened by predicted temperature increases associated with global climate change. To better understand how organisms respond to thermal landscapes and extremes, we investigated the thermal ecology of a gallinaceous bird species (northern bobwhite; Colinus virginianus, hereafter bobwhite) during a key life history period. Specifically, our study focused on the brood-rearing period of precocial bobwhite chicks associated with brood-attending adults. We measured site-specific black bulb temperatures (Tbb) and vegetation characteristics across 38 brood tracking days and 68 random landscape sites to assess thermal patterns at scales relevant to broods. We observed that the landscape was thermally heterogeneous, exhibiting variation in Tbb up to 408C during peak diurnal heating demonstrating a wide array of thermal choices available to broods. At 15:00 h, broods selected thermal refuges that moderated Tbb on average up to 10.48C more than landscape sites. Moreover, broods exhibited behavioral thermoregulation through reduced movement and by occupying more moderate microclimates that afforded taller vegetation structure during high heat. Modeled climate projections suggest that future Tbb in thermal refuges will approach those currently avoided on the landscape, emphasizing the need for future conservation plans that acknowledge fine scale thermal space in climate change scenarios. These findings underline that studying both abiotic and biotic factors at scales relevant to organisms can increase our understanding of how thermally heterogeneous landscapes provide thermal choices under extreme conditions.},

	abstract = {A long-distance edge effect influences structure of species-rich plant communities in temperate forest fragments surrounded by an agricultural landscape in Central Europe. Though the edge effect may be an aggregate of many environmental conditions, the thermal gradient from the forest edge to the forest interior deserves particular attention due to increasing ambient air temperature over the past decades. With regard to ongoing climate change, any reliable information about magnitude and distance of thermal gradients in these forest fragments has become of great importance. Therefore, we carried out seasonal measurements of forest air and soil temperature at a total 40 sites in 14 forest fragments in central Bohemia with areas ranging between 0.3 and 255 ha. In addition, we assessed spatial and vertical air temperature variability at two sites, on both south and north facing slopes. We found that differences in daily mean air temperature in these forest fragments is significantly modified by slope aspect (and/or slope inclination) and distance to the forest edge. A negative monotonic edge-related thermal gradient was apparent up to 100 m towards the forest interior with differences in daily mean air temperatures of about 0.3 °C. The magnitude of this edge thermal gradient is comparable to the effect of slope aspect. In addition to mean air temperature, maximum and minimum daily temperatures as well as mean soil temperature inside forest fragments also showed impacts caused by the edge effect and other environmental conditions (e.g. forest structure, elevation). The edge-related area closer than 100 m from the forest edge represents the majority (78\%) of forested land in the study area as well as a considerable part of temperate forests in Central Europe (40\%), including less fragmented mountain forests. Hence, the edge alteration of forest microclimate should be taken into serious consideration when planning adaptation measures against the consequences of climate change in Central Europe. The edge influence could be partially mitigated by preventing further forest fragmentation and the adoption of timber harvesting methods that avoid creation of clearings, such as single-tree selection. Even if such forest management measures are implemented in the study area, spatial patterns and gradients of environmental heterogeneity may be gradually reduced in the forest fragments as a result of further exposure to the combined effects of climate change and edge influence.},

Vegetation with a sufficient supply of water is able to cool down the surface by enhancing the latent heat flux via evapotranspiration. We chose seven types of land covers common in a temperate agricultural landscape and used a combined method of airship thermal scanning of Ts and ground measuring of thermodynamic Ta to show their Ts and Ta (air temperature) characteristics under high solar irradiance and their consequences for local climate; simultaneously we showed that this temperature difference increases with water content. A combined method of airship thermal scanning of Ts and ground measuring of thermodynamic Ta was used. The localities differed markedly in both the values and the dynamics of Ts and Ts-Ta. In the early afternoon the difference in Ts between the different land covers reached almost 20°C. Ecosystems with non-functional or no vegetation largely resembled the asphalt surface, whereas the ecosystems covered with dense, bushy or tree vegetation showed relatively well balanced daily temperature dynamics with low temperature extremes and a slow temperature morning increase or afternoon decrease. Ts-Ta at the peaking solar irradiance ranged between -1°C at the forest and 14-17°C at the dry harvested meadow and the asphalt surface respectively. We highlight the importance of Ts as a measurable indicator of ecosystem and landscape functioning and outline the importance of functional vegetation for climate.

	abstract = {Deforestation in mid-to high latitudes is hypothesized to have the potential to cool the Earth's surface by altering biophysical processes. In climate models of continental-scale land clearing, the cooling is triggered by increases in surface albedo and is reinforced by a land albedo-sea ice feedback. This feedback is crucial in the model predictions; without it other biophysical processes may overwhelm the albedo effect to generate warming instead. Ongoing land-use activities, such as land management for climate mitigation, are occurring at local scales (hectares) presumably too small to generate the feedback, and it is not known whether the intrinsic biophysical mechanism on its own can change the surface temperature in a consistent manner. Nor has the effect of deforestation on climate been demonstrated over large areas from direct observations. Here we show that surface air temperature is lower in open land than in nearby forested land. The effect is 0.85±0.44K (mean±one standard deviation) northwards of 45°N and 0.21±0.53K southwards. Below 35°N there is weak evidence that deforestation leads to warming. Results are based on comparisons of temperature at forested eddy covariance towers in the USA and Canada and, as a proxy for small areas of cleared land, nearby surface weather stations. Night-time temperature changes unrelated to changes in surface albedo are an important contributor to the overall cooling effect. The observed latitudinal dependence is consistent with theoretical expectation of changes in energy loss from convection and radiation across latitudes in both the daytime and night-time phase of the diurnal cycle, the latter of which remains uncertain in climate models. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

	abstract = {How organisms respond to and are influenced by temperature is one of the most fundamental aspects of ecology. Temperature affects animal physiology, behavior, survival, and reproduction. At broader spatial and temporal scales, temperature affects animal distributions, speciation, and evolution. Although entire textbooks have been devoted to how temperature is related to various aspects of basic animal ecology, applied ecologists have only recently begun to address thermal ecology in wildlife research. New investigations of thermal conditions relative to specific wildlife species have generally found tremendous variation within landscapes. Consequently, multiple species have been shown to respond in predictive ways to thermal variation. Variation in temperature can be due to both topoedaphic features inherent in the landscape as well as differences in vegetation structure and composition resulting from management actions. Although consideration of the thermal environment has received consideration for exothermic species, new evidence indicates that it has major implications to endotherms and may become even more critical under novel climate conditions. Rarely does management consider thermal cover explicitly or in a spatiotemporally dynamic way; in our view, this is a major short-coming of current conservation planning and management actions. We argue that thermal environments should be foundational in the understanding of the habitat concept. Furthermore, restoration and management efforts should specifically consider thermal refuge and pinch points—the discrete time or event when thermal conditions experienced by an organism deviate to extreme values relative to average conditions and limit vital rates and space use of that organism. We suggest that future research on thermal environments work at scales relevant to organisms so that management can adequately address the full extent of a species’ habitat. © 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {Understanding thermal ecology of endotherms is becoming increasingly important with predicted increases in temperature associated with climate change. Patterns of resource selection may depend in part on temperature thresholds outside which animals avoid warmer or cooler temperatures. During summer, northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus; hereafter bobwhite) in semiarid areas often exist at the limits of their thermal tolerance. We sought to determine (1) selection bounds for black globe and ground surface temperatures, (2) whether ground surface temperature is a better predictor of the thermal environment used by bobwhites than black globe temperature, and (3) how time of the day influences thermal resource use. We radio-marked 40 bobwhites and located them two to three times a week from April to September in 2014–2016. At each location, we measured ground surface and black globe temperatures at the bird location and at a location 20 m away in a random direction. We calculated continuous selection functions to estimate bounds of thermal characteristics suitable for bobwhites. We used generalized linear models to determine times of day bobwhites select cooler microclimates. Finally, we used case-controlled logistic regression models to generate thermal resource selection functions. We compared models that included ground surface temperature, black globe temperature, and an index created from both variables with principal component analysis and selected the best model based on Akaike's information criterion adjusted for sample size (AICc) and log-evidence ratios. Upper and lower selection bounds for black globe temperature and ground surface temperature were 24.5–42.5°C and 23.0–39.5°C, respectively. A principal component of black globe combined with ground surface temperature was a better predictor of bobwhite resource selection than either black globe temperature or ground surface temperature alone. In early afternoon (13:01–17:30 hours) during August, bobwhite locations had 13°C cooler black globe temperatures and 18°C cooler ground surface temperatures than random locations. Availability of thermally usable coverts (woody plant thickets) may be a limiting factor for bobwhites in the study area based on the findings that mean ground surface and black globe temperatures at used locations were close to the upper bounds for use in late summer during the middle of the day.},

	abstract = {Biodiversity information is an important basis for ecological research and environmental assessment, and can be impacted by choices made in the manipulation and analysis of taxonomic data. Such choices include methods for resolving multiple redundant levels of taxonomic resolution, as typically arise with morphological identification of damaged or immature aquatic macro-invertebrates. In particular, the effects of these processing choices on number of rare taxa are poorly understood yet potentially significant to the estimation of projected taxa richness and related evaluations such as biodiversity conservation value and survey sufficiency. Using aquatic macroinvertebrate data collected for two nearshore areas of Lake Superior, we determined how multiple methods of resolving taxonomic redundancies influence two commonly-used estimates of projected richness, Chao1 and Chao2, which hinge on the ratio of taxa that are singletons to doubletons (i.e., just one versus two individuals found) or uniques versus duplicates (i.e., just one versus two occurrences). We also determined how choice of ambiguous taxa method, including some modified specifically to retain rare taxa and others taken from the literature, influenced effort to reach 95\% of projected richness, site-level richness and abundance, and representative invertebrate IBI scores. We found that Chao1 was more sensitive to method choice than Chao2, because singleton and doubleton status was more frequently affected when taxa were deleted, merged, or re-assigned in the process of resolving taxonomic redundancies than was unique and duplicate status. Methods that eliminated redundant taxa at the site scale but not the study-area scale tended to overinflate study area and projected richness, and resulted in a significant loss of abundance. The method that aggregated or deleted redundant taxa depending on abundance resulted in a decrease in site and study area richness, abundance, and an underestimation of projected richness. Methods which re-assigned parents to common children retained a majority of richness and abundance information and a more realistic estimate of projected taxa richness; however, the identity of poorly-identified parents was imputed. All methods resulted in little effect to typical IBI scores. Overall, no one method is fully capable of removing spurious richness at the study-area scale while preserving all taxa occurrence, abundance and rarity patterns. Therefore, the most appropriate method for making comparisons among sites may be different than the most appropriate method for comparing among surveys or among study areas, or if a goal is to estimate projected taxa richness or retain rare taxa information.},

	abstract = {Sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems constitute the largest single North American shrub ecosystem and provide vital ecological, hydrological, biological, agricultural, and recreational ecosystem services. Disturbances have altered and reduced this ecosystem historically, but climate change may ultimately represent the greatest future risk. Improved ways to quantify, monitor, and predict climate-driven gradual change in this ecosystem is vital to its future management. We examined the annual change of Daymet precipitation (daily gridded climate data) and five remote sensing ecosystem sagebrush vegetation and soil components (bare ground, herbaceous, litter, sagebrush, and shrub) from 1984 to 2011 in southwestern Wyoming. Bare ground displayed an increasing trend in abundance over time, and herbaceous, litter, shrub, and sagebrush showed a decreasing trend. Total precipitation amounts show a downward trend during the same period. We established statistically significant correlations between each sagebrush component and historical precipitation records using a simple least squares linear regression. Using the historical relationship between sagebrush component abundance and precipitation in a linear model, we forecasted the abundance of the sagebrush components in 2050 using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) precipitation scenarios A1B and A2. Bare ground was the only component that increased under both future scenarios, with a net increase of 48.98 km$^{\textrm{2}}$ (1.1\%) across the study area under the A1B scenario and 41.15 km$^{\textrm{2}}$ (0.9\%) under the A2 scenario. The remaining components decreased under both future scenarios: litter had the highest net reductions with 49.82 km$^{\textrm{2}}$ (4.1\%) under A1B and 50.8 km$^{\textrm{2}}$ (4.2\%) under A2, and herbaceous had the smallest net reductions with 39.95 km$^{\textrm{2}}$ (3.8\%) under A1B and 40.59 km$^{\textrm{2}}$ (3.3\%) under A2. We applied the 2050 forecast sagebrush component values to contemporary (circa 2006) greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) habitat models to evaluate the effects of potential climate-induced habitat change. Under the 2050 IPCC A1B scenario, 11.6\% of currently identified nesting habitat was lost, and 0.002\% of new potential habitat was gained, with 4\% of summer habitat lost and 0.039\% gained. Our results demonstrate the successful ability of remote sensing based sagebrush components, when coupled with precipitation, to forecast future component response using IPCC precipitation scenarios. Our approach also enables future quantification of greater sage-grouse habitat under different precipitation scenarios, and provides additional capability to identify regional precipitation influence on sagebrush component response.},

Here, we aim to quantify the potential impacts of climate change on the distribution of climatically suitable habitat for sagebrush and on transmission risk for West Nile virus in the eastern portion of the species' range. We used Maxent to model the current and future climatically suitable habitat for two dominant sagebrush species in the study area, and we used a degree-day model to predict future West Nile virus transmission risk under likely climate-change scenarios. Our models suggest that areas with the highest future suitability for sagebrush habitat will be found in southwestern Wyoming and north-central Montana. The degree-day model suggests that greater sage-grouse in western portions of the study area, which are generally higher in elevation than where West Nile virus currently occurs, will see increasing risk of transmission in the future.

	abstract = {Models are useful tools for understanding and predicting ecological patterns and processes. Under ongoing climate and biodiversity change, they can greatly facilitate decision-making in conservation and restoration and help designing adequate management strategies for an uncertain future. Here, we review the use of spatially explicit models for decision support and to identify key gaps in current modelling in conservation and restoration. Of 650 reviewed publications, 217 publications had a clear management application and were included in our quantitative analyses. Overall, modelling studies were biased towards static models (79\%), towards the species and population level (80\%) and towards conservation (rather than restoration) applications (71\%). Correlative niche models were the most widely used model type. Dynamic models as well as the gene-to-individual level and the community-to-ecosystem level were underrepresented, and explicit cost optimisation approaches were only used in 10\% of the studies. We present a new model typology for selecting models for animal conservation and restoration, characterising model types according to organisational levels, biological processes of interest and desired management applications. This typology will help to more closely link models to management goals. Additionally, future efforts need to overcome important challenges related to data integration, model integration and decision-making. We conclude with five key recommendations, suggesting that wider usage of spatially explicit models for decision support can be achieved by 1) developing a toolbox with multiple, easier-to-use methods, 2) improving calibration and validation of dynamic modelling approaches and 3) developing best-practise guidelines for applying these models. Further, more robust decision-making can be achieved by 4) combining multiple modelling approaches to assess uncertainty, and 5) placing models at the core of adaptive management. These efforts must be accompanied by long-term funding for modelling and monitoring, and improved communication between research and practise to ensure optimal conservation and restoration outcomes.},

Model-based analyses are well suited to rapidly identifying and evaluating alternative actions but often lack explicit linkages between habitat conditions and population outcomes. We provide an example of how spatially explicit population modeling can uniquely inform conservation planning by integrating changes in habitat conditions with population responses. Using a case study of the critically endangered Greater Sage-grouse in Canada, we integrated habitat selection maps, demography and demographic risk maps, movement, and behavior into a predictive individual-based modeling framework. We used this framework to simulate population dynamics, evaluate demographic sensitivities, assess source-sink dynamics, and compared the population gains from restoring different types (strengths) of sinks. Sensitivity analysis results underscored the need for multiple, simultaneous population recovery actions to stabilize the population, including improving chick and adult survival. Strong source-sink dynamics were an emergent property of simulations, driven by the maladaptive selection of habitats with low chick survival and nest success. Simulated habitat restorations improving chick survival conditions in strong sinks were more effective at increasing abundance than actions targeting all sinks, or removing sinks. Spatially explicit population modeling can be an informative means of predicting and comparing potential population responses to habitat restoration and population recovery options. Individual-based modeling can uniquely evaluate habitat-population dynamics and can be particularly useful for critically endangered species, when too few animals or time remains to conduct field experiments.},

Interpreting velocity requires an assumption that climate trajectory length is proportional to climate change exposure; longer paths suggest greater exposure. However, distance is an imperfect measure of exposure because it does not quantify the extent to which trajectories traverse areas of dissimilar climate. Here we calculate velocity and minimum cumulative exposure (MCE) in degrees Celsius along climate trajectories for North America. We find that velocity is weakly related to MCE; each metric identifies contrasting areas of vulnerability to climate change. Notably, velocity underestimates exposure in mountainous regions where climate trajectories traverse dissimilar climates, resulting in high MCE. In contrast, in flat regions velocity is high where MCE is low, as these areas have negligible climatic resistance to movement. Our results suggest that mountainous regions are more climatically isolated than previously reported. Climate change velocity describes organism exposure to a modified climate, but as a distance-based metric, fails to consider that trajectories traverse dissimilar environments. Here, the authors calculate minimum cumulative exposure, finding that mountainous regions are particularly vulnerable.},

	abstract = {Aim: Bioclimatic envelope models are widely used to describe changes in climatically suitable areas for species under future climate scenarios. Climate change metrics are applied independently of species data to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of climate, and have also been used as indicators of the exposure of species to climate change. Here, we investigate whether these two approaches provide qualitatively similar indications about where biodiversity is potentially most exposed to climate change. Location: Sub-Saharan Africa. Methods: We compared a range of climate change metrics for sub-Saharan Africa with ensembles of bioclimatic envelope models for 2723 species of amphibians, snakes, mammals and birds. For each taxonomic group, we performed three comparisons between the two approaches: (1) is projected change in local climatic suitability (models) greater in grid cells with larger temporal differences in local climate (metrics); (2) are projected losses or gains of climatically suitable areas (models) greater for species in grid cells with climates that are projected to be less or more available in the future, respectively (metrics); and (3) are projected shifts in the position of climatically suitable areas (models) greater for species in grid cells with climates projected to move farther in space (metrics)? Results: The changes in climatic suitability projected by the bioclimatic envelope models covaried with the climatic changes measured with the metrics. Agreement between the two approaches was found for all taxonomic groups, although it was stronger for species with a narrower climatic envelope breadth. Main conclusions: For sub-Saharan African vertebrates, projected patterns of exposure to climate change given by climate change metrics alone were qualitatively comparable to bioclimatic model projections of changes in areas of suitable climate for species. Assessments based on climate change metrics can thus be useful for making first-cut inferences about the potential effects of climate change on regions with poorly known biodiversity.},

Location: California Floristic Province, south-western USA. Methods: Occurrences from presence/absence inventories of eight Californian endemic tree species (Pinus balfouriana [Grev.\&Balf.], Pinus coulteri [D.Don], Pinus muricata [D.Don.], Pinus sabiniana [D.Don], Quercus douglasii [Hook.\&Arn.], Quercus engelmannii [Greene], Quercus lobata [Nee] and Quercus wislizeni [A.DC.]) were used to develop eight species distribution models (SDMs) for each species with the BIOMOD platform, and this ensemble was used to construct current suitability maps and future projections based on two global circulation models in two time periods [mid-century: 2041-2070 and late century (LC): 2071-2100]. From the resulting current and future suitability maps, we calculated a bioclimatic velocity as the ratio of temporal gradient to spatial gradient. We developed and compared eight metrics of temporal exposure to climate change for mid- and LC for each species. Results: The velocity of species exposure to climate change varies across species and time periods, even for similarly distributed species. We find weak support among the species analysed for higher velocities in exposure to climate change towards the end of the 21st century, coinciding with harsher conditions. The variation in the pace of exposure was greater among species than for climate projections considered. Main conclusions: The pace of climate change exposure varies depending on period of analysis, species and the spatial extent of conservation decisions (potential ranges versus current distributions). Translating physical climatic space into a biotic climatic space helps informing conservation decisions in a given time frame. However, the influence of spatial and temporal resolution on modelled species distributions needs further consideration in order to better characterize the dynamics of exposure and species-specific velocities. © 2013 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

We evaluate how confidence in conservation recommendations may change with agreement among alternative climate projections and metrics of climate exposure. We assessed agreement among three multivariate estimates of climate exposure (forward velocity, backward velocity, and climate dissimilarity) using 18 alternative climate projections for the contiguous United States. For each metric, we classified maps into quartiles for each alternative climate projections, and calculated the frequency of quartiles assigned for each gridded location (high quartile frequency = more agreement among climate projections). We evaluated recommendations using a recent climate adaptation heuristic framework that recommends emphasizing various conservation strategies to land based on current conservation value and expected climate exposure. We found that areas where conservation strategies would be confidently assigned based on high agreement among climate projections varied substantially across regions. In general, there was more agreement in forward and backward velocity estimates among alternative projections than agreement in estimates of local dissimilarity. Consensus of climate predictions resulted in the same conservation recommendation assignments in a few areas, but patterns varied by climate exposure metric. This work demonstrates an approach for explicitly evaluating alternative predictions in geographic patterns of climate change.},

	abstract = {Key risks associated with projected climate trends for the 21st century include the prospects of future climate states with no current analog and the disappearance of some extant climates. Because climate is a primary control on species distributions and ecosystem processes, novel 21st-century climates may promote formation of novel species associations and other ecological surprises , whereas the disappearance of some extant climates increases risk of extinction for species with narrow geographic or climatic distributions and disruption of existing communities. Here we analyze multimodel ensembles for the A2 and B1 emission scenarios produced for the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, with the goal of identifying regions projected to experience (i) high magnitudes of local climate change, (ii) development of novel 21st-century climates, and/or (iii) the disappearance of extant climates. Novel climates are projected to develop primarily in the tropics and subtropics, whereas disappearing climates are concentrated in tropical mon-tane regions and the poleward portions of continents. Under the high-end A2 scenario, 12-39\% and 10-48\% of the Earth's terrestrial surface may respectively experience novel and disappearing climates by 2100 AD. Corresponding projections for the low-end B1 scenario are 4-20\% and 4-20\%. Dispersal limitations increase the risk that species will experience the loss of extant climates or the occurrence of novel climates. There is a close correspondence between regions with globally disappearing climates and previously identified biodiversity hotspots; for these regions, standard conservation solutions (e.g., assisted migration and networked reserves) may be insufficient to preserve biodiversity. biodiversity hotspots climate change dispersal limitations global-change ecology ecological surprises},

	doi = {10.1111/ddi.13275},
	abstract = {Aim: Correlative species distribution models (SDMs) are among the most frequently used tools for conservation planning under climate and land use changes. Conservation-focused climate change studies are often conducted on a national or local level and can use different sources of occurrence records (e.g., local databases, national biodiversity monitoring) collated at different geographic extents. However, little is known about how these restrictions in geographic space (i.e., Wallacean shortfall) can lead to restrictions in environmental space (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall) and accordingly affect conclusions about a species' vulnerability to climate change. Location: Americas with a focus on Mexico. Methods: We present an example study constructing SDMs for three Mexican tree species (Alnus acuminata, Liquidambar styraciflua and Quercus xalapensis) using data-sets collated at a global (Americas), national (Mexico) and local (cloud forests of eastern Mexico) level to demonstrate the potential effects of a Wallacean shortfall on the estimation of the environmental niche-and thus on a Hutchinsonian shortfall-its projection in space and time and, consequently, on species' potential vulnerability to climate change. Results: The consequence of using the three datasets was species-specific and strongly depended on the extent to which the Wallacean shortfall affected estimations of environmental niches (i.e., Hutchinsonian shortfall). Where restrictions in geographic space lead to an underestimation of the environmental niche, vulnerability to climate change was estimated to be substantially higher. Additionally, the restrictions in geographic space may increase the likelihood of issues with non-analogue climates, increasing model uncertainty. Main conclusion: We recommend assessing the extent to which a species' entire realized environmental niche is captured within the target conservation area, and increasing the geographic extent, if needed, to account for environments and occurrences reflecting potential future conditions.

	abstract = {Aim Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to determine threats to biodiversity and opportunities under climate change. Despite SDMs being based on the assumption of complete knowledge of the climate space of the modelled species, truncated occurrence datasets (and hence truncated climate spaces) such as national inventories are often employed. This may lead to prediction errors, which have been proposed to stem from: (1) the degree of climate space truncation and/or (2) instability of the modelling algorithms. Our aim was to explore the potential causes of prediction errors in SDMs using truncated training datasets. Location Europe 11° W-32° E, 34°-72° N. Methods SDMs employing commonly used bioclimatic variables were applied to seven forest tree species. We created two model training datasets covering: (1) Germany only (significantly truncated climate space) and (2) Europe (minimally truncated climate space). Differences between the climate space represented by Germany-only and European data were measured on two-dimensional climate spaces obtained through principal component analysis of the bioclimatic variables. Seven SDM algorithms were run, and the stability of the response function and variable selection for each species and model type were analysed. Results The degree of climate space truncation was less important for model performance than the instability of model algorithms and indiscriminate variable selection. The latter led to irrelevant relationships of species occurrence with bioclimatic variables. These instabilities caused pronounced prediction errors. Main conclusions Our results strongly suggest that erroneous model predictions stem from instability and ecological irrelevance of the statistical functions relating the probability of a species' occurrence to bioclimatic variables, compounded by a lack of consistency in variable selection. Models displaying these characteristics showed lower overall performance when trained with truncated datasets. Further, commonly used ensemble approaches do not compensate for the shortfalls of individual models. Detailed model-by-model and species-by-species analysis of response functions and variable importance is recommended.},

Many refinements have been made to the methodology over the years, and the result has been an approach that considers multiple sources of variation in geographic predictions, and how that variation translates into both specific predictions and uncertainty in those predictions. Although numerous previous reviews and overviews of this field have pointed out a series of assumptions and caveats associated with the methodology, three aspects of the methodology have important impacts but have not been treated previously in detail. Here, we assess those three aspects: (1) effects of niche truncation on model transfers to future climate conditions, (2) effects of model selection procedures on future-climate transfers of ecological niche models, and (3) relative contributions of several factors (replicate samples of point data, general circulation models, representative concentration pathways, and alternative model parameterizations) to overall variance in model outcomes. Overall, the view is one of caution: although resulting predictions are fascinating and attractive, this paradigm has pitfalls that may bias and limit confidence in niche model outputs as regards the implications of climate change for species’ geographic distributions.},

	abstract = {As the rate and magnitude of climate change accelerate, understanding the consequences becomes increasingly important. Species distribution models (SDMs) based on current ecological niche constraints are used to project future species distributions. These models contain assumptions that add to the uncertainty in model projections stemming from the structure of the models, the algorithms used to translate niche associations into distributional probabilities, the quality and quantity of data, and mismatches between the scales of modeling and data. We illustrate the application of SDMs using two climate models and two distributional algorithms, together with information on distributional shifts in vegetation types, to project fine-scale future distributions of 60 California landbird species. Most species are projected to decrease in distribution by 2070. Changes in total species richness vary over the state, with large losses of species in some ''hotspots'' of vulnerability. Differences in distributional shifts among species will change species co-occurrences, creating spatial variation in similarities between current and future assemblages. We use these analyses to consider how assumptions can be addressed and uncertainties reduced. SDMs can provide a useful way to incorporate future conditions into conservation and management practices and decisions, but the uncertainties of model projections must be balanced with the risks of taking the wrong actions or the costs of inaction. Doing this will require that the sources and magnitudes of uncertainty are documented, and that conservationists and resource managers be willing to act despite the uncertainties. The alternative, of ignoring the future, is not an option. birds California ecological niche species distribution models conservation T he world is changing rapidly, because of the cascading and intertwined effects of human population growth, widespread poverty, economic globalization, land-use change, and, looming over it all, climate change. These changes are having profound effects on biological diversity, effects that will only become more dramatic and dire as the pace of environmental change quickens. The challenges to conservation and environmental management are immense. Traditionally, conservation has focused on protecting individual species and their habitats. This focus derives from more than a century of work describing the relationships between organisms and features of the environment. Virtually all of this work has been shaped by thinking about ecological niches. Niche concepts and theory, in the form of ''ecological niche models'' or ''bioclimatic envelope models'' (1, 2), have become central in efforts to understand how future climate change may have an impact on species and their habitats. In this paper, after providing a brief perspective on ''ecological niches,'' we describe how niche thinking and modeling have been used to project changes in the distributions of species and consider several assumptions and uncertainties. We illustrate the approach with examples from our work on California birds and conclude by assessing the usefulness of niche-based models for projecting climate-change impacts on biodiversity and the implications for conservation and management.},

	abstract = {Empirically derived species distributions models (SDMs) are increasingly relied upon to forecast species vulnerabilities to future climate change. However, many of the assumptions of SDMs may be violated when they are used to project species distributions across significant climate change events. In particular, SDM's in theory assume stable fundamental niches, but in practice, they assume stable realized niches. The assumption of a fixed realized niche relative to climate variables remains unlikely for various reasons, particularly if novel future climates open up currently unavailable portions of species' fundamental niches. To demonstrate this effect, we compare the climate distributions for fossil-pollen data from 21 to 15 ka bp (relying on paleoclimate simulations) when communities and climates with no modern analog were common across North America to observed modern pollen assemblages. We test how well SDMs are able to project 20th century pollen-based taxon distributions with models calibrated using data from 21 to 15 ka. We find that taxa which were abundant in areas with no-analog late glacial climates, such as Fraxinus, Ostrya/Carpinus and Ulmus, substantially shifted their realized niches from the late glacial period to present. SDMs for these taxa had low predictive accuracy when projected to modern climates despite demonstrating high predictive accuracy for late glacial pollen distributions. For other taxa, e.g. Quercus, Picea, Pinus strobus, had relatively stable realized niches and models for these taxa tended to have higher predictive accuracy when projected to present. Our findings reinforce the point that a realized niche at any one time often represents only a subset of the climate conditions in which a taxon can persist. Projections from SDMs into future climate conditions that are based solely on contemporary realized distributions are potentially misleading for assessing the vulnerability of species to future climate change. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The question of when to monitor and when to act is fundamental to applied ecology and notoriously difficult to answer. Value of information (VOI) theory holds great promise to help answer this question for many management problems. However, VOI theory in applied ecology has only been demonstrated in single-decision problems and has lacked explicit links between monitoring and management costs. Here, we present an extension of VOI theory for solving multi-unit decisions of whether to monitor before managing, while explicitly accounting for monitoring costs. Our formulation helps to choose the optimal monitoring/management strategy among groups of management units (e.g. species, habitat patches) and can be used to examine the benefits of partial and repeat monitoring. To demonstrate our approach, we use case-simulated studies of single-species protection that must choose among potential habitat areas, and classification and management of multiple species threatened with extinction. We provide spreadsheets and code to illustrate the calculations and facilitate application. Our case studies demonstrate the utility of predicting the number of units with a given outcome for problems with probabilities of discrete states and the efficiency of having a flexible approach to manage according to monitoring outcomes. Synthesis and applications. The decision to act or gather more information can have serious consequences for management. No decision, including the decision to monitor, is risk-free. Our multi-unit expansion of Value of Information theory can reduce the risk in monitoring/acting decisions for many applied ecology problems. While our approach cannot account for the potential value of discovering previously unknown threats or ecological processes via monitoring programmes, it can provide quantitative guidance on whether to monitor before acting, and which monitoring/management actions are most likely to meet management objectives.},

This requires conservation managers to strike a challenging balance between direct action, which is needed to avoid further biodiversity loss, and research and monitoring, which provide the information needed for more effective action. Here, we explore different types of management tasks in action plans for legally protected species at risk of extinction in Canada, and determine the proportion of effort allocated to research and monitoring. We found that 46\% of management tasks in action plans were research and monitoring, largely involving area-based management planning (12\%), population monitoring (12\%), and research examining conservation actions and techniques (11\%). Of the management tasks that were categorized as actions, the largest number (35\%) were related to education and awareness. The proportion of management tasks allocated to research and monitoring were highest for species with higher risk of extinction (i.e., Endangered vs. No Status). This suggests that either less is known about these species or that fear of negative outcomes for especially imperiled species may deter necessary actions. Our findings underscore the need to carefully examine the value of collecting new information and consider the optimal allocation of resources between action and research and monitoring to maximize the recovery of species at risk of extinction.},

Here, we advocate for the expanded use of a third approach: non-random resampling of previously-collected data. This approach conducts experiments with available data to understand the consequences of different monitoring approaches. We first illustrate non-random resampling in determining the optimal length and frequency of monitoring programs to assess species trends. We then apply the approach to a pair of additional case studies, from fisheries and agriculture. Non-random resampling of previously-collected data is underutilized, but has the potential to improve monitoring programs.},

	abstract = {Classifying species into risk categories is a ubiquitous process in conservation decision-making affecting regulatory procedures, conservation actions, and guiding resource allocation at global, national, and regional scales. However, monitoring programs often do not provide data required for accurate species classification decisions. Misclassification can lead to otherwise preventable species extinctions, undue regulatory burden, poor allocation of limited conservation resources, and can undermine species conservation legislation. We developed a framework that evaluates monitoring designs based on the ability to correctly inform a species classification decision, where minimizing the risk of misclassification is the central objective. We further evaluated monitoring designs by calculating the expected value of information and explored the relationship between statistical power to detect trends and misclassification. Our measure of misclassification risk, which can be tailored to the decision context, clarified the costs of over- and under-protection. High power to detect trends often corresponded to accurate species classification decisions. However, in several scenarios power to detect trends was low but the ability to correctly inform the classification decision was high. The value of information generally increased with monitoring intensity and quantified the tradeoffs between spatial and temporal replication. Our framework allows managers to assess monitoring program performance with direct implications for conservation decision-making. Our framework affords practitioners an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of monitoring programs a priori focusing on improving conservation decisions. We demonstrate that prioritizing monitoring to minimize misclassification errors can improve monitoring efficiency and conservation decision-making with considerable practical applications and benefits for species conservation.},

The promise of adaptive management is that learning in the short-term will improve management in the long-term; that promise is best kept if the focus of learning is on those uncertainties that most impede achievement of management objectives. In this context, an existing tool of decision analysis, the expected value of perfect information (EVPI), is particularly valuable in identifying the most important uncertainties. Expert elicitation can be used to develop preliminary predictions of management response under a series of hypotheses, as well as prior weights for those hypotheses, and the EVPI can be used to determine how much management could improve if uncertainty was resolved. These methods were applied to management of whooping cranes (Grus americana), an endangered migratory bird that is being reintroduced in several places in North America. The Eastern Migratory Population of whooping cranes had exhibited almost no successful reproduction through 2009. Several dozen hypotheses can be advanced to explain this failure, and many of them lead to very different management responses. An expert panel articulated the hypotheses, provided prior weights for them, developed potential management strategies, and made predictions about the response of the population to each strategy under each hypothesis. Multi-criteria decision analysis identified a preferred strategy in the face of uncertainty, and analysis of the expected value of information identified how informative each strategy could be. These results provide the foundation for design of an adaptive management program.},

One of possible approaches supporting the process is Bayesian statistical decision theory providing a mathematical model to make decisions of a technical nature in conditions of uncertainty. Regarding above, a detailed subject of the research is to analyze the value of the observation, which is a part of preposterior analysis. For the presented network, the main objective was to determine, conducting of which of three tests is the most valuable from the perspective of determining possible need or possibility to omission expensive technical expertise. The basis of verification, which test is the most valuable, is therefore the comparison of expected value of sample information (EVSI) for each of the three tests. The main advantage of preposterior analysis is answering the question which of the considered experiments is potentially the best source of information and what cost needs to be incurred on its execution (price of new information). If the cost of such an examination is relatively small compared to the value of information on the state of nature, this implies a direct recommendation to conduct the experiment. In conclusion, the construction of the decision-making model being a reflection of the state of nature allows to determine the ranking of decisions, including those regarding selection of the optimal test. It is noteworthy, that test result itself can contribute to an increase in the expected value of the decision involved, but on the other hand, the reduction of uncertainty may be considerably outweighed to the necessity to incur expenses for this examination.},

This comprehensive review of methods for modeling and solving VOI problems for applications related to EHRM provides the first synthesis of important methodological advances in the field. The insights provide risk analysts and decision scientists with some guidance on how to structure and solve VOI problems focused on evaluating opportunities to collect better information to improve EHRM decisions.

Our goal was to develop a model that would allow managers to identify landscape-scale targets for industrial development, while ensuring functional habitat for sustainable caribou populations. We examined the relationship between functional habitat loss resulting from cumulative effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbance, and the rate of population change (Λ) for 6 populations of boreal caribou in Alberta, Canada. We defined functional habitat loss according to 2 variables for which we had a priori reasons to suspect causative associations with Λ: 1) percentage area of caribou range within 250 m of anthropogenic footprint, and 2) percentage of caribou range disturbed by wildfire within the last 50 years. Multiple regression coefficients for both independent variables indicated significant effects on Λ. The 2-predictor model explained 96\% (R2) of observed variation in Λ among population units (F2,3 = 35.2, P = 0.008). The model may be used to evaluate plans for industrial development in relation to predicted wildfire rates and goals for caribou population growth rates.},

	abstract = {Conserving species-at-risk requires quantifiable knowledge of the key drivers of population change. Non-linear demographic responses to habitat loss have been documented for many species and may serve to establish quantitative habitat thresholds for management purposes. In Canada, boreal populations of woodland caribou are considered threatened; Environment Canada's empirical model of calf recruitment-range disturbance suggests that at least 65\% undisturbed habitat is required to ensure viability. We tested the relationship upon which this conservation guideline is based by pairing demographic estimates with range conditions over a 10-year period for three boreal caribou populations. Our objectives were (1) to evaluate evidence of intra-population demographic responses to fluctuations in range quality over time; (2) to evaluate inter-population differences in demographic responses to cumulative range disturbances; and (3) to evaluate the sensitivity of disturbance tolerance thresholds to variation in local population demography. We found strong evidence in support of the disturbance-recruitment relationship for within-population responses over time (R-2 = 0.77). Mixed effects logistic regression modeling revealed variations in local population responses to cumulative habitat depletion. Range-specific disturbance thresholds derived from Monte Carlo simulations were highly elastic in response to observed variation in local population demography, suggesting that 65\% undisturbed habitat is insufficient when adult female survival and/or sex ratio is suboptimal. Study populations were determined to be not self-sustaining (Pr(lambda ae{\textless}yen{\textgreater} 0.99) = 37-47\%). Adult survival was comparable to estimates reported elsewhere despite Aboriginal harvesting for subsistence purposes. Results underscored potential trade-offs between forest harvesting and wildlife habitat conservation. Protection and restoration of sufficient quantities of undisturbed habitat, particularly via road reclamation, is essential for caribou population recovery.},

	abstract = {Nowhere across Canada is the continued persistence of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) more uncertain than in Alberta due to widespread industrial development. A recent Government of Canada critical habitat review determined that habitat conditions within all Alberta boreal ecotype caribou ranges are unlikely or very unlikely to allow for self-sustaining caribou populations. This habitat-based assessment was based only indirectly on empirical population trends. Here, we estimated empirical population trend and growth rate (λ) for 13 of Alberta’s 16 remaining woodland caribou populations (plus one adjacent population from Saskatchewan) from 1994 to 2012 using demographic monitoring of adult female survival and calf recruitment. We captured and radio-collared a total of 1337 adult female caribou in 14 populations and estimated the mean annual adult female survival across all populations as 0.851. We conducted 158 late-winter calf recruitment surveys across the 14 populations classifying 20 872 caribou and estimated mean recruitment of 0.154 calves/cow (i.e., 0.077 female calves/cow). We then combined annual estimates of adult female survival and female calf recruitment within each population in a simple age-structured population model to estimate population trend. Annual population growth rate across caribou populations averaged 0.918, and was significantly declining, λ {\textless} 1.0, for 10 of the 14 caribou populations. Our results confirm that woodland caribou are declining rapidly (with a realized decline of approximately 50\% every 8 years) across Alberta, and support conclusions from previous habitat-based assessments that the population viability of caribou is currently compromised, supporting development and implementation of recovery actions to reverse trends.},

	abstract = {Environmental impact assessments often rely on best available information, which may include models that were not designed for purpose and are not accompanied by an assessment of limitations. We reproduced available models of boreal woodland caribou resource selection and demography and evaluated their suitability for projecting impacts of development in the Ring of Fire on boreal caribou in the Missisa range (Ontario, Canada). The specificity of the resource selection model limited usefulness for predicting impacts, and high variability in model coefficients among ranges suggests responses vary with habitat availability. The aspatial demographic model projects decreasing survival and recruitment with increasing disturbance, but high variability among populations implies the importance of these impacts depends on population status, and there is no current status estimate. New models that are designed for forecasting, informed by more current herd status information and information from neighbouring ranges, are required to better inform decisions. To demonstrate how open-source tools and reproducible workflows can improve the transparency and reusability of models we developed an R package for data preparation, resource selection, and demographic calculations. Open-source tools, reproducible workflows, and reuseable forecasting models can improve our collective ability to inform wildlife management decisions in a timely manner.},

	abstract = {Conflicts between economic development and conservation are increasingly hampering efforts to restore imperiled wildlife populations. Public opinion can influence how these conflicts translate into conservation actions, encouraging stakeholders to express their views through various public channels. The outcome of these campaigns typically remains unknown. Via an online survey, we collected to the opinion of 1000 citizens of Québec, Canada, regarding the ongoing conflict between logging and the conservation of at-risk caribou populations (Rangifer tarandus). We found that people expect conservation actions that are sufficient to recover caribou populations, even if millions of government investment are required and jobs are lost in the process. When respondents learned that academic caribou researchers indicated that the two management strategies being studied by government would be insufficient for population recovery, one-third withdrew their support for either strategy. Age, gender and education all explain variation in public opinion, but it was the region of residence that most consistently explained variation in opinion. Residents of caribou-inhabited regions were less concerned about caribou conservation and more supportive of forestry than residents of other regions, reflecting regional differences in expected economic impacts of conservation, not negative interactions with caribou. In fact, most people supported strong conservation actions for the recovery of caribou populations, regardless of their socio-demographics. Our analysis provides general insights into how public opinion on the trade-off between conservation and economy is influenced by socio-demographics and scientific conclusions. We found that current government conservation actions (or lack thereof) are not in line with mainstream public opinion. Moreover, we show that making species at-risk lists does not ensure that the species will benefit from strong conservation actions without lengthy delays, even for a high-profile, flagship species like caribou. This observation echoes concerns about the fate of less charismatic, at-risk species, and thus about future biodiversity conservation efforts.},

In the eyes of conservationists and many social and cultural groups, logging in the boreal forest areas—on which the woodland caribou herds depend—appears to be unacceptable. Moreover, in the eyes of the forestry stakeholders, both industrial players and the communities that depend on this sector, it seems just as unacceptable to undermine industrial forestry activities for the conservation of woodland caribou populations. Based on the concept of social acceptability, this study offers an analysis of the debates associated with the conservation of woodland caribou in Quebec. This contribution is based on the press review methodology, in which we highlight the arguments, justifications, and measures proposed by different groups of stakeholders according to the regimes of rationality in which they fit, so as to outline the social acceptability issues emerging from this controversy.},

We examined variation among populations and species in the magnitude of estimates of error components and density dependence using generalized linear models. Process error exceeded observation error in 75\% of all populations and on average, both components of error were greater in Rangifer than in Cervus populations. Observation error differed significantly across the different observation methods and predation and time-series length differentially affected the error components.

	abstract = {Landscapes in Canada are undergoing change due to resource and land use stressors and climate stressors. Understanding the cumulative effects of these stressors is challenging because of the complexity of ecosystems, the variability of stressors, and species response to individual or multiple stressors. A key challenge within the field of cumulative effects assessment (CEA) is guidance that describes and evaluates analytical methods. In this review we discuss four broad categories of methods with current or potential use for project-based and effects-based CEA for species in terrestrial systems: (i) qualitative review, (ii) habitat supply models, (iii) empirical species–stressor models, and (iv) decision support models. We describe each method and provide examples, highlight advantages and limitations, identify how methods address key science-based CEA questions, and provide direction on when and why to use specific CEA methods. Empirical species–stressor models and decision support models are the only analytical approaches that provide answers to many science-based CEA questions including how multiple stressors combine to affect an individual species and the certainty of multiple stressor effects. We provide recommendations for using one or more methods as complementary building blocks to fill data gaps, improve understanding and communication, engage diverse partner groups, and increase the quality and credibility of the CEA. Our review supports a move toward regional scale, effects-based CEA where partner collaboration to design, implement, and analyze comprehensive assessments of multiple stressors will (i) expand our knowledge of terrestrial species response to stressors and (ii) inform best management practices for resource industries and conservation and management actions for land managers.},

	abstract = {As global conservation actions become more urgent, informed decision-making requires robust analyses of the costs and benefits of policy options, based on available evidence. Recovery planning for threatened or endan-gered species must assume a cause-and-effect relationship between proposed management interventions and population responses. However, a significant portion of current knowledge about threatened or endangered species is derived from observational studies because experiments that fully meet random and controlled design criteria are largely infeasible or unethical. Large-scale field experiments are becoming more common, yet the greater uncertainty generated by what remain fundamentally observational studies can lead researchers to weak inferences about causal mechanisms, creating debate and confusion among decision-makers, planners and stakeholders. This has been an acute problem facing conservationists and governments as they struggle with the successful recovery of species in decline. In other domains where experimental evidence is difficult to collect, causal modelling has been adopted to identify causal relationships from observational data, based on a set of strong assumptions and identification rules. In Canada, significant and ongoing efforts have had limited success in reversing the population decline of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). We examine the scientific framework for woodland caribou recovery efforts through the lens of causal modelling, highlighting feasible steps that could be taken to improve the rigour of causal inferences.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, declines of Canadian populations of boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) have received considerable attention from scientists, government agencies, environmental nongovernmental organizations, Indigenous communities, and the forest industry. Boreal caribou (also known as boreal woodland caribou) was listed as a threatened species in Canada when the Species at Risk Act came into force in June 2003. Many boreal caribou populations have been shown to be decreasing, in some cases precipitously, and empirical evidence from adult survival and calf recruitment surveys indicates that the cumulative effect of habitat disturbance, including that which results from industrial development, is a key driver in the decline. Yet, as scientific understanding of the decline has become clearer, and agreement among scientists and governments about habitat management requirements has increased, campaigns of denial have intensified in the public sphere. In this paper, we examine parallels with climate change rhetoric prolific in the 2000s and show that willful ignorance disguised as skepticism has resulted in public uncertainty despite robust scientific evidence. We show how these strategies of manufactured uncertainty used in climate change denial campaigns have seeped into wildlife management debates, with pernicious results. In this case, it has successfully delayed efforts to effectively address the decline of boreal caribou, which is protected under federal, provincial, and territorial legislation, and inhibited meaningful dialogue about socially acceptable conservation solutions. © 2018 The Wildlife Society.},

Network analyses of familial relationships may provide insights on how these parameters influence population-level demographic patterns. These methods, however, have rarely been applied to genetically derived pedigree data from wild populations. Here, we use parent–offspring relationships to construct familial networks from polygamous boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in Saskatchewan, Canada, to inform recovery efforts. We collected samples from 933 individuals at 15 variable microsatellite loci along with caribou-specific primers for sex identification. Using network measures, we assess the contribution of individual caribou to the population with several centrality measures and then determine which measures are best suited to inform on the population demographic structure. We investigate the centrality of individuals from eighteen different local areas, along with the entire population. We found substantial differences in centrality of individuals in different local areas, that in turn contributed differently to the full network, highlighting the importance of analyzing networks at different scales. The full network revealed that boreal caribou in Saskatchewan form a complex, interconnected familial network, as the removal of edges with high betweenness did not result in distinct subgroups. Alpha, betweenness, and eccentricity centrality were the most informative measures to characterize the population demographic structure and for spatially identifying areas of highest fitness levels and family cohesion across the range. We found varied levels of dispersal, fitness, and cohesion in family groups. Synthesis and applications: Our results demonstrate the value of different network measures in assessing genetically derived familial networks. The spatial application of the familial networks identified individuals presenting different fitness levels, short- and long-distance dispersing ability across the range in support of population monitoring and recovery efforts.},

Here, we examined the effects of variable spatially explicit density on a range of demographic parameters in a wild population of a cryptic ungulate, boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou). Using non-invasive genetic sampling, we applied spatial capture–recapture methods with landscape covariates to estimate the density of boreal woodland caribou across a 108,806 km2 study area. We then created a familial network from the reconstructed parent–offspring relationships to determine whether spatial density influenced sex-specific individual reproductive success, female pregnancy status, and dispersal distance. We found that animal density varied greatly in response to land cover types and disturbance; animal density was most influenced by landscape composition and distance to roads varying from 0 in areas with {\textgreater}20\% deciduous cover to 270 caribou per 1,000 km2 in areas presenting contiguous older coniferous cover. We found that both male and female reproductive success varied with density, with males showing a higher probability of having offspring in higher-density areas, and the opposite for females. No differences were found in female pregnancy rates occurring in high- and low-density areas. Dispersal distances varied with density, with offspring moving shorter distances when parents were found in higher-density areas. Familial networks showed lower-closeness centrality and lower-degree centrality for females in higher-density areas, indicating that females found in higher-density areas tend to be less broadly associated with animals across the range. Although high-density areas do reflect good-quality caribou habitat, the observed decreased closeness and degree centrality measures, dispersal rates, and lower female recruitment rates suggest that remnant habitat patches across the landscape may create population sinks.},

Recent developments in ecological-based network methods have created active research interest in areas such as animal behaviour, community ecology, and landscape connectivity. With the increasing availability of genetic data from wild populations, network analysis has become a viable and important method for the study of both between and within population genetics. However, to date there is a lack of cohesion in the methodology and terminology used in genetic networks, making it difficult for researchers to undertake network analysis or follow field-specific best practices. Here, we conducted a literature review of studies that use genetic-based networks to describe and analyse population structure, genetic connectivity, dispersal, and to understand individual level of genetic relatedness. We categorise studies as population-level networks and individual-based genetic networks, based on their node definition, and discuss the commonalities and differences between these approaches. Additionally, we present an overview of the current methods and software available for the construction and analysis of genetic networks. Lastly, we discuss how genetic networks can effectively contribute to the field of conservation biology, with particular focus on defining population structure/units, understanding genetic connectivity, dispersal, and detecting source/sink dynamics, as well as addressing how genetic networks can aid studies of individual or familial fitness and understanding population inbreeding and bottlenecks.},

	abstract = {Determining age structure of populations is a valuable parameter in wildlife management, but is often difficult to obtain. Here, we tested a noninvasive method via fecal DNA, hormones, and pellet morphometrics to distinguish calf from adult in Central Mountain and Boreal woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) populations. Annual surveys of fall-sampled Central Mountain caribou were done in Jasper National Park, Alberta, between 2006 and 2011 and winter-sampled Boreal caribou were surveyed in the North Interlake area, Manitoba, between 2004 and 2010. Samples were amplified at 10 microsatellite loci to identify unique individuals and capture histories were used to identify putative calves and adults. Fecal pellets were measured for length, width, depth, dry mass, and analyzed for progesterone, estrogen, and testosterone concentrations. Results showed significant differences in fecal pellet size between putative calves and adults for both sexes and populations–seasons. Progesterone concentration was significantly higher in Jasper–fall and North Interlake–winter adult females. Testosterone was significantly higher in Jasper–fall adult males. North Interlake–winter males exhibited no significant difference in hormone concentrations between age classes. When applied to the entire Jasper data set, 98\% of females and 88\% of males were assigned to an age class. This study illustrates the possibilities of using noninvasive methods to determine an age class in wild ungulate populations.},

	abstract = {Population ecology has matured to a sophisticated science with astonishing potential for contributing solutions to wildlife conservation and management challenges. And yet, much of the applied power of wildlife population ecology remains untapped because its broad sweep across disparate subfields has been isolated in specialized texts. In this book, L. Scott Mills covers the full spectrum of applied wildlife population ecology, including genomic tools for non-invasive genetic sampling, predation, population projections, climate change and invasive species, harvest modeling, viability analysis, focal species concepts, and analyses of connectivity in fragmented landscapes. With a readable style, analytical rigor, and hundreds of examples drawn from around the world, Conservation of Wildlife Populations (2nd ed) provides the conceptual basis for applying population ecology to wildlife conservation decision-making. Although targeting primarily undergraduates and beginning graduate students with some basic training in basic ecology and statistics (in majors that could include wildlife biology, conservation biology, ecology, environmental studies, and biology), the book will also be useful for practitioners in the field who want to find - in one place and with plenty of applied examples - the latest advances in the genetic and demographic aspects of population ecology.

            Roads fragment landscapes and trigger human colonization and degradation of ecosystems, to the detriment of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. The planet’s remaining large and ecologically important tracts of roadless areas sustain key refugia for biodiversity and provide globally relevant ecosystem services. Applying a 1-kilometer buffer to all roads, we present a global map of roadless areas and an assessment of their status, quality, and extent of coverage by protected areas. About 80\% of Earth’s terrestrial surface remains roadless, but this area is fragmented into {\textasciitilde}600,000 patches, more than half of which are {\textless}1 square kilometer and only 7\% of which are larger than 100 square kilometers. Global protection of ecologically valuable roadless areas is inadequate. International recognition and protection of roadless areas is urgently needed to halt their continued loss.},

Yet human agencies commonly overlook spatio-temporal variations in productivity by recommending fixed resource extraction thresholds. We studied the influence of forest productivity on habitat disturbance levels that boreal caribou – a threatened, late-seral ungulate under top-down control – should be able to withstand. Based on 10 years of boreal caribou monitoring, we found that adult survival and recruitment to populations decreased with landscape disturbance, but increased with forest productivity. This benefit of productivity reflected the net outcome of an increase in resources for apparent competitors and predators of caribou, and a more rapid return to the safety of mature conifer forests. We estimated 3-fold differences in forest harvesting levels that caribou populations could withstand due to variations in forest productivity. The adjustment of ecosystem provisioning services to local forest productivity should provide strong conservation and socio-economic advantages.},

	abstract = {Human activities can impact animal communities by altering species interactions. The influence of forest harvesting on the interaction between threatened boreal caribou, moose, and wolves constitutes a classic example. When conifer forests are logged, clear-cuts are colonized by deciduous vegetation that provides high-quality food for moose. Subsequent changes in wolf distribution alter predation risk for caribou. Given that primary productivity varies along latitudinal gradients, the effects of logging on moose-caribou-wolf interactions could also vary moving northwards. Empirical evidence, however, is lacking and current recommendations for caribou conservation are fixed over space. We assessed whether the impact of logging activities on caribou-moose-wolf interactions varies with latitude. We estimated deciduous vegetation availability from satellite imagery, and followed all three species with GPS collars to evaluate their habitat selection. We found that the availability of deciduous vegetation in logged stands decreased along a 400-km latitudinal gradient. The probability of caribou occurrence remained low in clear-cuts, regardless of deciduous vegetation availability. Moose and wolves increased their selection for clear-cuts as they contained more deciduous vegetation. Accordingly, the relative co-occurrence probability of moose and wolves was strongly associated with clear-cuts at low latitudes, but weakly so at high latitudes. Clear-cuts should therefore attract moose and wolves more strongly to prime boreal caribou habitat at lower latitudes, and caribou predation risk should follow similar geographical patterns. Conservation planning should account for geographical patterns in the risk faced by threatened populations because the effectiveness of strategies developed from average patterns can decrease over space, in consistent manner.},

We note that while the human population has increased by 23\% and the world economy has grown 153\%, the human footprint has increased by just 9\%. Still, 75\% the planet’s land surface is experiencing measurable human pressures. Moreover, pressures are perversely intense, widespread and rapidly intensifying in places with high biodiversity.

Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

This second edition of the highly acclaimed Effective Ecological Monitoring describes what makes monitoring programs successful and how to ensure that long-term monitoring studies persist. The book has been fully revised and updated but remains concise, illustrating key aspects of effective monitoring with case studies and examples. It includes new sections comparing surveillance-based and question-based monitoring, analysing environmental observation networks, and provides examples of adaptive monitoring. Based on the authors’ 80 years of collective experience in running long-term research and monitoring programs, Effective Ecological Monitoring is a valuable resource for the natural resource management, ecological and environmental science and policy communities.},

This requires conservation managers to strike a challenging balance between direct action, which is needed to avoid further biodiversity loss, and research and monitoring, which provide the information needed for more effective action. Here, we explore different types of management tasks in action plans for legally protected species at risk of extinction in Canada, and determine the proportion of effort allocated to research and monitoring. We found that 46\% of management tasks in action plans were research and monitoring, largely involving area-based management planning (12\%), population monitoring (12\%), and research examining conservation actions and techniques (11\%). Of the management tasks that were categorized as actions, the largest number (35\%) were related to education and awareness. The proportion of management tasks allocated to research and monitoring were highest for species with higher risk of extinction (i.e., Endangered vs. No Status). This suggests that either less is known about these species or that fear of negative outcomes for especially imperiled species may deter necessary actions. Our findings underscore the need to carefully examine the value of collecting new information and consider the optimal allocation of resources between action and research and monitoring to maximize the recovery of species at risk of extinction.},

We argue that conservation actions that could aid ESPs are sometimes delayed because of a fear of failure. In human psychology, the fear of failure is composed of several distinct cognitive elements, including “uncertainty about the future” and “upsetting important others.” Uncertainty about the future is often driven by information obstacles in conservation: information is either not easily shared among practitioners or information is lacking. Whereas, fear of upsetting important others can be due to apprehension about angering constituents, peers, funders, and other stakeholders. We present several ways to address these fears in hopes of improving the conservation process. We describe methods for increased information sharing and improved decision-making in the face of uncertainty, and recommend a shift in focus to cooperative actions and improving methods for evaluating success. Our hope is that by tackling stumbling blocks due to the apprehension of failure, conservation and management organizations can take steps to move from fear to action.},

	abstract = {Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 1325–1337 Abstract There is a growing view that to make efficient use of resources, ecological monitoring should be hypothesis-driven and targeted to address specific management questions. ‘Targeted’ monitoring has been contrasted with other approaches in which a range of quantities are monitored in case they exhibit an alarming trend or provide ad hoc ecological insights. The second form of monitoring, described as surveillance, has been criticized because it does not usually aim to discern between competing hypotheses, and its benefits are harder to identify a priori. The alternative view is that the existence of surveillance data may enable rapid corroboration of emerging hypotheses or help to detect important ‘unknown unknowns’ that, if undetected, could lead to catastrophic outcomes or missed opportunities. We derive a model to evaluate and compare the efficiency of investments in surveillance and targeted monitoring. We find that a decision to invest in surveillance monitoring may be defensible if: (1) the surveillance design is more likely to discover or corroborate previously unknown phenomena than a targeted design and (2) the expected benefits (or avoided costs) arising from discovery are substantially higher than those arising from a well-planned targeted design. Our examination highlights the importance of being explicit about the objectives, costs and expected benefits of monitoring in a decision analytic framework.},

Yet most of Australia's imperiled species continue to decline or go extinct and a contributing cause is inadequate investment in conservation management. However, this has been difficult to evaluate because the extent of funding committed to such recovery in Australia, like in many nations, is opaque. Here, by collating disparate published budget figures of Australian governments, we show that annual spending on targeted threatened species recovery is around U.S.\$92m (AU\$122m) which is around one tenth of that spent by the U.S. endangered species recovery program, and about 15\% of what is needed to avoid extinctions and recover threatened species. Our approach to estimating funding needs for species recovery could be applied in any jurisdiction and could be scaled up to calculate what is needed to achieve international goals for ending the species extinction crisis. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {Listing endangered and threatened species under the US Endangered Species Act is presumed to offer a defense against extinction and a solution to achieve recovery of imperiled populations, but only if effective conservation action ensues after listing occurs. The amount of government funding available for species protection and recovery is one of the best predictors of successful recovery; however, government spending is both insufficient and highly disproportionate among groups of species, and there is significant discrepancy between proposed and actualized budgets across species. In light of an increasing list of imperiled species requiring evaluation and protection, an explicit approach to allocating recovery funds is urgently needed. Here I provide a formal decision-theoretic approach focusing on return on investment as an objective and a transparent mechanism to achieve the desired recovery goals. I found that less than 25\% of the \$1.21 billion/year needed for implementing recovery plans for 1,125 species is actually allocated to recovery. Spending in excess of the recommended recovery budget does not necessarily translate into better conservation outcomes. Rather, elimination of only the budget surplus for “costly yet futile” recovery plans can provide sufficient funding to erase funding deficits for more than 180 species. Triage by budget compression provides better funding for a larger sample of species, and a larger sample of adequately funded recovery plans should produce better outcomes even if by chance. Sharpening our focus on deliberate decision making offers the potential to achieve desired outcomes in avoiding extinction for Endangered Species Act-listed species.},

However, conventional statistical PVA requires long-term data from every population of interest, whereas many species of concern exist in multiple isolated populations that are only monitored occasionally. We present a hierarchical multi-population viability analysis model that increases inference power from sparse data by sharing information among populations to assess extinction risks while accounting for incomplete detection and sampling biases with explicit observation and sampling sub-models. We present a case study in which we customized this model for historical population monitoring data (1985-2015) from federally threatened Lahontan cutthroat trout populations in the Great Basin, USA. Data were counts of fish captured during backpack electrofishing surveys from locations associated with 155 isolated populations. Some surveys (25\%) included multi-pass removal sampling, which provided valuable information about capture efficiency. GIS and remote sensing were used to estimate August stream temperatures, peak flows, and riparian vegetation condition in each population each year. Field data were used to derive an annual index of nonnative trout densities. Results indicated that population growth rates were higher in colder streams and that nonnative trout reduced carrying capacities of native trout. Extinction risks increased with more environmental stochasticity and were also related to population extent, water temperatures, and nonnative densities. We developed a graphical user interface to interact with the fitted model results and to simulate future habitat scenarios and management actions to assess their influence on extinction risks in each population. Hierarchical multi-population viability analysis bridges the gap between site-level field observations and population-level processes, making effective use of existing datasets to support management decisions with robust estimates of population dynamics, extinction risks, and uncertainties.},

Standard models now allow unbiased estimation of occupancy probability when false negative detections occur, but this is conditional on no false positive detections and sufficient incorporation of explanatory variables for the false negative detection process. These assumptions are likely reasonable in many circumstances, but there is mounting evidence that false positive errors and detection probability heterogeneity may be much more prevalent in studies relying on auditory cues for species detection (e.g., songbird or calling amphibian surveys). We used field survey data from a simulated calling anuran system of known occupancy state to investigate the biases induced by these errors in dynamic models of species occurrence. Despite the participation of expert observers in simplified field conditions, both false positive errors and site detection probability heterogeneity were extensive for most species in the survey. We found that even low levels of false positive errors, constituting as little as 1\% of all detections, can cause severe overestimation of site occupancy, colonization, and local extinction probabilities. Further, unmodeled detection probability heterogeneity induced substantial underestimation of occupancy and overestimation of colonization and local extinction probabilities. Completely spurious relationships between species occurrence and explanatory variables were also found. Such misleading inferences would likely have deleterious implications for conservation and management programs. We contend that all forms of observation error, including false positive errors and heterogeneous detection probabilities, must be incorporated into the estimation framework to facilitate reliable inferences about occupancy and its associated vital rate parameters.},

	abstract = {Whether a species is rare or overabundant, accurate estimates of population abundance are essential for the development and assessment of conservation plans and management goals. Aerial surveys are commonly used to estimate population abundance and a variety of methods have been used to account for recognized biases associated with imperfect detection. Rarely addressed, however, is the possibility of recording duplicate observations and the influence of duplicate observations on estimates of abundance. Using data provided by Global Positioning System (GPS)-collared bison (Bison bison) and helicopter survey paths conducted during 2011-2013 in the Henry Mountains, Utah, USA, we determined whether GPS-collared bison were observed, missed, or observed multiple times. Using these data, covariates hypothesized to influence observation errors, and generalized linear models, we found the probability of detecting a GPS-collared bison (study-wide mean of 95\%) was consistently greater for individuals in larger groups and less rugged terrain. We also found that the probability of recording a duplicate observation (study-wide mean of 4.4\%) increased with time since the prior survey observation. By incorporating both types of observation error into a modified Horvitz-Thompson estimator, more accurate estimates of bison abundance can be attained, particularly in years when animals segregate into small groups, utilize terrain that makes them difficult to see, or have ample time to move into areas not yet surveyed and be counted again. Our approach of accounting for multiple sources of observation error can easily be applied to aerial surveys for other species in other systems, and has the potential to improve the rigor of wildlife abundance estimation from aerial surveys.
