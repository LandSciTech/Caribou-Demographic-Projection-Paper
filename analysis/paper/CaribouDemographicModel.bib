	abstract = {Abstract: Survival estimation is an important aspect of population ecology and conservation biology, and radiotelemetry is a major tool for assessing factors influencing survival time in free-ranging birds and mammals. Despite the advantage of telemetry in providing extensive and continuous survival information, telemetry-based survival estimates can be biased or imprecise when methods are misused. Simple cumulative survival estimators like the Heisey and Fuller and Kaplan-Meier methods have underlying assumptions and sampling requirements that commonly remain unverified by researchers. Telemetry studies often limit survival analysis to simple univariate tests that do not consider the range of factors potentially influencing mortality risk in free-ranging animals. Continuous-time modeling approaches like Cox Proportional Hazards or Anderson–Gill methods, or their discrete-time analogues, are superior because they are robust to a range of study design limitations and can handle multiple categorical or continuous covariates including those that vary with time or subject age. Parametric models may be difficult to fit in telemetry studies because the appropriate hazard function in wildlife populations usually is not known. The main assumptions in survival study design are that 1) subjects represent the population of interest, 2) mortality risk is independent between subjects, and 3) subjects are lost to follow-up (i.e., censored) randomly. These assumptions are prone to violation in telemetry research, and their assessment and possible remediation should be prioritized. Telemetry studies often are characterized by small sample size or short duration; both attributes lead to low numbers of mortalities and thus lack of precision in the survival estimate. I conclude that telemetry-based survival estimation will benefit from increased emphasis on modeling approaches designed to elucidate survival determinants in complex systems, combined with more rigorous attention to basic assumptions and study design limitations.},

	abstract = {Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are threatened in Canada, with population and distribution declines evident in most regions of the country. Causes of declines are linked to landscape change from forest fires and human development, notably forestry oil and gas activities, which result in caribou habitat loss and affect ecosystem food webs. The Federal Species at Risk Act requires effective protection and restoration of caribou habitat, with actions to increase caribou survival. These requirements call for effective monitoring of caribou population trends to gauge success. Many woodland caribou populations are nearly impossible to count using traditional aerial survey methods, but demographic-based monitoring approaches can be used to estimate population trends based on population modeling of vital rates from marked animals. Monitoring programs have used a well-known simple population model (the Recruitment-Mortality [R/M] equation) to estimate demographic rates for woodland caribou, but have faced challenges in managing large data streams and providing transparency in the demographic estimation process. We present a stand-alone statistical software application using open-source software to permit efficient, transparent, and replicable demographic estimation for woodland caribou populations. We developed an easy-to-use, interactive web-based application for the R/M population model that uses a Bayesian estimation approach and provides the user flexibility in choice of prior distributions and other output features. We illustrate the web-application to the A la Pêche Southern Mountain (Central Group) woodland caribou population in west-central Alberta, Canada, during 1998–2017. Our estimates of population demographics are consistent with previous research on this population and highlight the utility of the application in assessing caribou population responses to species recovery actions. We provide example data, computer code, the web-based application package, and a user manual to guide installation and use. We also review underlying assumptions and challenges of population monitoring in this case study. We expect our software will contribute to efficient monitoring of woodland caribou and help in the assessment of recovery actions for this species. © 2019 The Authors.

Here, we pay specific attention to various forms of censoring and truncation that present challenges for telemetry-based monitoring of survival. We use simulations to assess how uncertainty about times of death and imperfect detection probabilities affect Kaplan–Meier survival estimates. We then treat monitoring of threatened woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in west-central Alberta as a case study to test for potential effects of non-random right censoring and interval censoring on survival estimates. We report that monitoring frequency (e.g., daily vs. monthly) and associated uncertainty about the exact time of death do not inherently induce bias on Kaplan–Meier point estimates of survival nor affect estimates of variance. Removing individuals from the at-risk pool during intervals for which they were not detected did induce a negative bias on resulting survival estimates when the probability of detection was independent of the animals' fates. We recommend using subsequent detections to impute animals' fates during missed intervals in such cases when all animals' fates are eventually known or permanently right censored and when missed detections are not related to changes in mortality risk. Although some assumptions remain difficult to test and of continued concern, we find no evidence of biases in the methodology of Alberta's woodland caribou monitoring program. Our results lend credence to recent evidence of widespread declines in woodland caribou populations across the province. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

Although adult female survival has the highest elasticity for ungulate population dynamics, the more variable recruitment rates are commonly monitored to track local variation in growth rates. Specifically, recruitment is often measured using late winter young:adult age ratios, though these age ratios are difficult to reliably interpret given the contribution of multiple vital rates to annual ratios. We show that the supplementation of age ratio data with concurrent radio-telemetry monitoring of adult female survival allows both retrospective estimation of empirical population growth rates and the decomposition of recruitment-specific vital rates. We demonstrate the estimation of recruitment and population growth rates for 1 woodland caribou population using these methods, including elasticity and life-stage simulation analysis of the relative contribution of adult female survival and recruitment rates to variation in population growth. We show, for this woodland caribou population, that adult female survival and recruitment rates were nearly equivalent drivers of population growth. We recommend the concurrent monitoring of adult female survival to reliably interpret age ratios when managing caribou and other ungulates. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Environmental impact assessments often rely on best available information, which may include models that were not designed for purpose and are not accompanied by an assessment of limitations. We reproduced available models of boreal woodland caribou resource selection and demography and evaluated their suitability for projecting impacts of development in the Ring of Fire (RoF) on boreal caribou in the Missisa range (Ontario, Canada). The specificity of the resource selection model limited usefulness for predicting impacts, and high variability in model coefficients among ranges suggests responses vary with habitat availability. The aspatial demographic model projects decreasing survival and recruitment with increasing disturbance, but high variability among populations implies the importance of these impacts depends on the status of the Missisa population, and there no current status estimate. New models that are designed for forecasting the cumulative effects of development and climate change are required to better inform RoF decisions. To demonstrate how open-source tools and reproducible workflows can improve the transparency and reusability of models we developed an R package for data preparation, resource selection, and demographic calculations. Open-source tools, reproducible workflows, and reuseable forecasting models can improve our collective ability to inform wildlife management decisions in a timely manner.},

	abstract = {The decline of many woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations is thought to be linked with habitat disturbances resulting from industrial development, including timber harvesting and its network of haul roads. Defining a disturbance-abundance relationship offers a tool to assess and potentially manage for the influence of disturbance on caribou abundance. Defining this relationship is challenged by limited historical land use and abundance data, the choice of a disturbance measure, and variability in the relationship between subpopulations and across core versus matrix habitat. For 12 subpopulations of woodland caribou within the southern mountain population, we linked longitudinal caribou abundance data with historical forestry disturbances simulated from forest harvest data. We compared disturbance measures estimating the proportion of forested area commercially harvested with even-aged, regeneration treatments (cutblocks) and converted to roads for transporting timber within subpopulation-specific core and matrix habitats as predictors of caribou abundance. Non-linear mixed models provided evidence that disturbances in matrix habitats negatively influenced caribou abundance, with the effects in core habitat being variable between subpopulations. Of the disturbance types evaluated, the best predictors included roads buffered by 50 m (R50), cutblocks ≤80 years old, and the cumulation of cutblocks ≤80 years old plus roads buffered by 50 m. The top-ranked model was composed of R50 present in core and in matrix habitats. This model predicted a 42\% (95\% CI = 33–51\%) reduction in caribou abundance for every 1\% increase in matrix R50 (holding core R50 constant). Given the lack of pre-forestry abundance data, we failed to directly derive critical disturbance thresholds; however, our models could be used to estimate subpopulation-specific habitat-disturbance thresholds necessary to achieve abundance targets. We recommend that in addition to existing protections of core habitat, few if any new roads should be built in core habitat, and that timber harvest in matrix habitat should be designed to minimize the establishment of associated roads.},

	abstract = {Integrated population models (IPMs) represent the single, unified analysis of population count data and demographic data. This modelling framework is quite novel and can be implemented within the classical or the Bayesian mode of statistical inference. Here, we briefly show the basic steps that need to be taken when an integrated population model is adopted, and review existing integrated population models for birds and mammals. There are important advantages of integrated compared to conventional analyses that analyse each dataset separately and then try to make an inference about population dynamics. First, integrated population models allow the estimating of more demographic quantities, because there is information about all demographic processes operating in a population, and this information is exploited. Second, parameter estimates become more precise, and this enhances statistical power. Finally, all sources of uncertainty due to process variability and the sampling process(es) are adequately included. Core of the integrated models is the link of changes in the population size and the demographic rates via a demographic model (usually a Leslie matrix model) and the likelihoods of all existing datasets. We discuss some critical assumptions that are typically made in integrated population models and highlight fruitful areas of future research. Currently, we have found 25 studies that used integrated population models. Central to most studies was statistical development rather than their application to address an ecological question, which is not surprising given that integrated population models are still a new development. We predict that integrated population models will become a common and important tool in studies of population dynamics, both in ecology and its applications, such as conservation biology or wildlife management.},

	abstract = {Assessing the impacts of ongoing climate and anthropogenic-induced change on wildlife populations requires understanding species distributions and abundances across large spatial and temporal scales. For threatened or declining populations, collecting sufficient broad-scale data is challenging as sample sizes tend to be low because many such species are rare and/or elusive. As a result, demographic data are often piecemeal, leading to difficulties in determining causes of population changes and developing strategies to mitigate the effects of environmental stressors. Thus, the population dynamics of threatened species across spatio-temporal extents is typically inferred through incomplete, independent, local-scale studies. Emerging integrative modeling approaches, such as integrated population models (IPMs), combine multiple data types into a single analysis and provide a foundation for overcoming problems of sparse or fragmentary data. In this paper, we demonstrate how IPMs can be successfully implemented by synthesizing the elements, advantages, and novel insights of this modeling approach. We highlight the latest developments in IPMs that are explicitly relevant to the ecology and conservation of threatened species, including capabilities to quantify the spatial scale of management, source-sink dynamics, synchrony within metapopulations, and population density effects on demographic rates. Adoption of IPMs has led to improved detection of population declines, adaptation of targeted monitoring schemes, and refined management strategies. Continued methodological advancements of IPMs, such as incorporation of a wider set of data types (e.g., citizen science data) and coupled population-environment models, will allow for broader applicability within ecological and conservation sciences.},

	abstract = {Population monitoring can take many different forms, and monitoring elusive and endangered species frequently involves a variety of sparse data from different sources. Small populations are often hard to sample precisely and without bias, so when estimates of vital rates like survival or recruitment point to conflicting population trends, it can be hard to determine which is more correct. Furthermore, data can be extremely hard to collect on small populations and it can be helpful to find a way to use all available hard-won data. To address these issues, we developed an integrated population model (IPM) using all available data to estimate vital rates and abundance for a case study of an endangered woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) population. This IPM allowed us to incorporate data from juvenile recruitment surveys, telemetry-based survival, aerial population counts and mark–resight data, and non-invasive capture–recapture DNA data to better understand population status and trend. We estimated survival, abundance, and recruitment of four age classes of male and female caribou: young, juveniles, subadults, and adults. The four-age class structure of the IPM allowed us to estimate recruitment from reproductive-aged female caribou alone, even though it can be difficult to distinguish age classes—and even sexes—in the field. As part of our IPM, we developed a novel mixture model to break apart data from different age classes when age is unobservable, as it typically is from non-invasive DNA samples. This helped us decrease bias in juvenile and adult survival estimates from scat data, which was important to our understanding of the population dynamics. Overall, our integrated model provided more precise estimates of population trends than any one method (e.g., telemetry or non-invasive DNA) alone. This IPM provides a useful, flexible tool for biologists to monitor populations and provides a valuable example of the benefits of integrated population modeling approaches for endangered species management and recovery.},

Although IPMs have been used in population ecology and fisheries management, their use in wildlife management has been limited. Data sets available for North American waterfowl are unprecedented in terms of time span ({\textgreater}60 years) and geographic coverage, and are especially well-suited for development of IPMs that could improve the understanding of population ecology and help guide future harvest and habitat management decisions. In this overview, we illustrate 3 potential benefits of IPMs: integration of multiple data sources (i.e., population counts, mark-recapture data, and fecundity estimates), increased precision of parameter estimates, and ability to estimate missing demographic parameters by reanalyzing results from a historical study of canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria). Drawing from our own published and unpublished work, we demonstrate how IPMs could be used to identify the critical vital rates that have had the greatest influence on population change in lesser scaup (Aythya affinis), evaluate potential mechanisms of harvest compensation for American black ducks (Anas rubripes), or prioritize the most appropriate places to conduct habitat management to benefit northern pintails (Anas acuta). Integrated population models provide a powerful platform for evaluating alternative hypotheses about population regulation and they have potential to advance the understanding of wildlife ecology and help managers make ecologically based decisions. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.},

	abstract = {Recovering endangered species is a difficult and often controversial task that challenges status quo land uses. Southern Mountain caribou are a threatened ecotype of caribou that historically ranged in southwestern Canada and northwestern USA and epitomize the tension between resource extraction, biodiversity conservation, and Indigenous Peoples' treaty rights. Human-induced habitat alteration is considered the ultimate cause of caribou population declines, whereby an increased abundance of primary prey—such as moose and deer—elevates predator populations and creates unsustainable caribou mortality. Here we focus on the Klinse-Za and Quintette subpopulations, part of the endangered Central Group of Southern Mountain caribou in British Columbia. These subpopulations were trending toward immediate extirpation until a collaborative group initiated recovery by implementing two short-term recovery actions. We test the effectiveness of these recovery actions—maternity penning of adult females and their calves, and the reduction of a primary predator, wolves—in increasing vital rates and population growth. Klinse-Za received both recovery actions, whereas Quintette only received wolf reductions, providing an opportunity to test efficacy between recovery actions. Between 1995 and 2021, we followed 162 collared female caribou for 414 animal-years to estimate survival and used aerial counts to estimate population abundance and calf recruitment. We combined these data in an integrated population model to estimate female population growth, total population abundance, and recovery action effectiveness. Results suggest that the subpopulations were declining rapidly (λ = 0.90–0.93) before interventions and would have been functionally extirpated ({\textless}10 animals) within 10–15 years. Wolf reduction increased population growth rates by 0.12 for each subpopulation. Wolf reduction halted the decline of Quintette caribou and allowed them to increase (λ = 1.05), but alone would have only stabilized the Klinse-Za (λ = 1.02). However, maternity penning in the Klinse-Za increased population growth by a further 0.06, which when combined with wolf reductions, allowed populations to grow (λ = 1.08). Taken together, the recovery actions in these subpopulations increased adult female survival, calf recruitment, and overall population growth, more than doubling abundance. Our results suggest that maternity penning and wolf reductions can be effective at increasing caribou numbers in the short term, while long-term commitments to habitat protection and restoration are made.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference is an important statistical tool that is increasingly being used by ecologists. In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. Bayes’ Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

We developed an integrated population model to study the dynamics of the only remnant population of endangered whooping cranes (Grus americana) in North America, 1977–2013. Despite much conservation attention for this species, there has been little study on temporal variability in demography and how that variation contributes to population dynamics. Demographic rates were most variable for fledge rate and survival of the youngest age classes while adult survival was less variable. Population growth was influenced mainly by variation in fledge rate, breeding propensity and survival of hatch year and second year cranes while survival of older age classes had less influence. Fledge rates were correlated to the boreal snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus)–Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) cycle and were lowest 2years after increases in lynx population growth. In terms of management, mean annual fledge rates were similar between years with and without egg collection for captive rearing (0.523 vs 0.518), suggesting no influence of this practice on population-level productivity. Our findings add to the growing body of results showing that while population growth may be most sensitive to changes in adult survival in long-lived vertebrates, variation in breeding parameters often drives annual fluctuations in abundance. Maintaining adult whooping crane survival at currently high rates and increasing breeding output where possible may be effective management strategies for achieving conservation goals.},

	abstract = {A challenge for making conservation decisions is predicting how wildlife populations respond to multiple, concurrent threats and potential management strategies, usually under substantial uncertainty. Integrated modeling approaches can improve estimation of demographic rates necessary for making predictions, even for rare or cryptic species with sparse data, but their use in management applications is limited. We developed integrated models for a population of diamondback terrapins (Malaclemys terrapin) impacted by road-associated threats to (i) jointly estimate demographic rates from two mark-recapture datasets, while directly estimating road mortality and the impact of management actions deployed during the study; and (ii) project the population using population viability analysis under simulated management strategies to inform decision-making. Without management, population extirpation was nearly certain due to demographic impacts of road mortality, predators, and vegetation. Installation of novel flashing signage increased survival of terrapins that crossed roads by 30\%. Signage, along with small roadside barriers installed during the study, increased population persistence probability, but the population was still predicted to decline. Management strategies that included actions targeting multiple threats and demographic rates resulted in the highest persistence probability, and roadside barriers, which increased adult survival, were predicted to increase persistence more than other actions. Our results support earlier findings showing mitigation of multiple threats is likely required to increase the viability of declining populations. Our approach illustrates how integrated models may be adapted to use limited data efficiently, represent system complexity, evaluate impacts of threats and management actions, and provide decision-relevant information for conservation of at-risk populations.},

Data contain missing values and inaccurate censuses. From limited data ecologists attempt to predict life history schedules and population growth. We extend the “missing value” framework for Bayesian analysis of structured populations to admit the heterogeneity in demography and the limitations of data that are typical of ecological populations. Our hierarchical treatment of capture–recapture data allows inference on demographic rates contained in matrix transition models for populations that may be stratified by location and by other variables. Simulations with artificial data sets demonstrate the ability of the Bayesian model to successfully estimate underlying parameters, even with incomplete census data. In contrast, traditional nonhierarchical models may lead to biased parameter estimates because of variation in recapture rates of individuals. Analyses of published demographic data on Common Terns and Taitu Hills rats illustrate the utility of the model. Predictive distributions of maturation age, survivorship, and population growth demonstrate profound impacts of population and data complexity.},

	abstract = {To successfully respond to changing habitat, climate or harvest, managers need to identify the most effective strategies to reverse population trends of declining species and/or manage harvest of game species. A classic approach in conservation biology for the last two decades has been the use of matrix population models to determine the most important vital rates affecting population growth rate (λ), that is, sensitivity. Ecologists quickly realized the critical role of environmental variability in vital rates affecting λ by developing approaches such as life-stage simulation analysis (LSA) that account for both sensitivity and variability of a vital rate. These LSA methods used matrix-population modeling and Monte Carlo simulation methods, but faced challenges in integrating data from different sources, disentangling process and sampling variation, and in their flexibility. Here, we developed a Bayesian integrated population model (IPM) for two populations of a large herbivore, elk (Cervus canadensis) in Montana, USA. We then extended the IPM to evaluate sensitivity in a Bayesian framework. We integrated known-fate survival data from radio-marked adults and juveniles, fecundity data, and population counts in a hierarchical population model that explicitly accounted for process and sampling variance. Next, we tested the prevailing paradigm in large herbivore population ecology that juvenile survival of neonates {\textless}90 d old drives λ using our Bayesian LSA approach. In contrast to the prevailing paradigm in large herbivore ecology, we found that adult female survival explained more of the variation in λ than elk calf survival, and that summer and winter elk calf survival periods were nearly equivalent in importance for λ. Our Bayesian IPM improved precision of our vital rate estimates and highlighted discrepancies between count and vital rate data that could refine population monitoring, demonstrating that combining sensitivity analysis with population modeling in a Bayesian framework can provide multiple advantages. Our Bayesian LSA framework will provide a useful approach to addressing conservation challenges across a variety of species and data types.},

It is a short introductory guide to this popular form of decision making and is aimed at environmental managers and scientists. This is a distinctly pragmatic label given to ways for helping individuals and groups think through tough multidimensional choices characterized by uncertain science, diverse stakeholders, and difficult tradeoffs. This is the everyday reality of environmental management, yet many important decisions currently are made on an ad hoc basis that lacks a solid value-based foundation, ignores key information, and results in selection of an inferior alternative. Making progress – in a way that is rigorous, inclusive, defensible and transparent – requires combining analytical methods drawn from the decision sciences and applied ecology with deliberative insights from cognitive psychology, facilitation and negotiation. The authors review key methods and discuss case-study examples based in their experiences in communities, boardrooms, and stakeholder meetings. The goal of this book is to lay out a compelling guide that will change how you think about making environmental decisions.

	abstract = {Accurate and precise population estimates for the forest-dwelling ecotype of Woodland Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) are very difficult to obtain because these Caribou are found at very low densities and in small herds dispersed over large areas. In order to suggest a standardized method, data from aerial surveys conducted in 1991 and 1993 (12 000 km2 blocks) were used to simulate various survey scenarios. Simulations showed that all the major groups of Caribou would have to be found and counted to obtain a confidence interval of ± 20\% (α = 0.10). We tested this technique in a survey carried out in winter 1999 in a 42 539 km2 study site, opting for a total coverage carried out in two phases. In phase one, we used an airplane, flying north-south transects spaced 2.1 km apart so as to detect most Caribou track networks. In phase two, a helicopter was used to count and determine the sex and age classes (calves/adults) of Caribou found in phase one. Using 20 radio-collared Caribou, the visibility rate of Caribou groups (phase one) and that of Caribou within the groups (phase two) were estimated at 0.90 and 0.94 respectively for an overall rate of 0.85 (SE = 0.08; α = 0.10). The corrected density was estimated at 1.6 Caribou per 100 km2 with a 15\% confidence interval (α = 0.10). The survey cost approximately \$4/km2, which is lower than that of two previous surveys (\$7/km2). Two main factors contributed to diminish costs: (1) the use of long-range airplanes (5-7 hours flying range) in phase one to minimize travel between the airports and the study site, and (2) the use of helicopters only in phase two for counting and determining the age and sex of the Caribou.Il est très difficile d’obtenir des estimations de population exactes et précises pour l’écotype forestier du Caribou des bois (Rangifer tarandus caribou) parce qu’on le retrouve en très faibles densités et qu’il est distribué en petites hardes réparties sur de vastes superficies. Les résultats de deux inventaires aériens réalisés en 1991 et 1993 (12 000 km2) ont été utilisés pour simuler divers scénarios d’inventaire afin de suggérer une méthode standardisée. Les simulations ont montré qu’il fallait trouver et recenser tous les groupes principaux pour obtenir un intervalle de confiance de ± 20 \% (α = 0,10). Nous avons testé cette approche dans un site d’étude de 42 539 km2 où nous avons opté pour un plan en deux phases. En phase un, l’avion a été utilisé pour couvrir totalement le site d’étude selon des virées équidistantes de 2,1 km afin de détecter la plupart des réseaux de pistes. L’hélicoptère fut utilisé en phase deux pour dénombrer et sexer les Caribous dans les réseaux de pistes détectés en phase un. D’après 20 Caribous munis de colliers émetteurs, le taux de visibilité global était de 0,85 (SE = 0,08; α = 0,10), soit 0,90 en phase 1 et 0,94 en phase 2. La densité corrigée était de 1,6 Caribou par 100 km2 avec une erreur relative de 15 \% (α = 0,10). L’inventaire a coûté 4 \$/km2, ce qui est inférieur aux montants investis lors des inventaires antérieurs (7 \$/km2). La diminution des coûts est attribuable à deux facteurs principaux : (1) l’utilisation d’avions à grand rayon d’action (5-7 heures d’autonomie) pour minimiser les déplacements en phase un; (2) l’emploi d’hélicoptères exclusivement pour le dénombrement et le sexage des caribous.},

	abstract = {Nowhere across Canada is the continued persistence of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou (Gmelin, 1788)) more uncertain than in Alberta due to widespread industrial development. A recent Government of Canada critical habitat review determined that habitat conditions within all Alberta boreal ecotype caribou ranges are unlikely or very unlikely to allow for self-sustaining caribou populations. This habitat-based assessment was based only indirectly on empirical population trends. Here, we estimated empirical population trend and growth rate (λ) for 13 of Alberta’s 16 remaining woodland caribou populations (plus one adjacent population from Saskatchewan) from 1994 to 2012 using demographic monitoring of adult female survival and calf recruitment. We captured and radio-collared a total of 1337 adult female caribou in 14 populations and estimated the mean annual adult female survival across all populations as 0.851. We conducted 158 late-winter calf recruitment surveys across the 14 populations classifying 20 872 caribou and estimated mean recruitment of 0.154 calves/cow (i.e., 0.077 female calves/cow). We then combined annual estimates of adult female survival and female calf recruitment within each population in a simple age-structured population model to estimate population trend. Annual population growth rate across caribou populations averaged 0.918, and was significantly declining, λ {\textless} 1.0, for 10 of the 14 caribou populations. Our results confirm that woodland caribou are declining rapidly (with a realized decline of approximately 50\% every 8 years) across Alberta, and support conclusions from previous habitat-based assessments that the population viability of caribou is currently compromised, supporting development and implementation of recovery actions to reverse trends.},

	abstract = {In lifetesting, medical follow-up, and other fields the observation of the time of occurrence of the event of interest (called a death) may be prevented for some of the items of the sample by the previous occurrence of some other event (called a loss). Losses may be either accidental or controlled, the latter resulting from a decision to terminate certain observations. In either case it is usually assumed in this paper that the lifetime (age at death) is independent of the potential loss time; in practice this assumption deserves careful scrutiny. Despite the resulting incompleteness of the data, it is desired to estimate the proportion P(t) of items in the population whose lifetimes would exceed t (in the absence of such losses), without making any assumption about the form of the function P(t). The observation for each item of a suitable initial event, marking the beginning of its lifetime, is presupposed. For random samples of size N the product-limit (PL) estimate can be defined as follows: List and label the N observed lifetimes (whether to death or loss) in order of increasing magnitude, so that one has 0 ≤ t$_{\textrm{1}}$' ≤ t$_{\textrm{2}}$' ≤ ⋯ ≤ t$_{\textrm{N}}$'. Then {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}hat\{P\}(t) = {\textbackslash}prod\_r {\textbackslash}lbrack(N - r)/(N - r + 1){\textbackslash}rbrack\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater}, where r assumes those values for which t$_{\textrm{r}}$' ≤ t and for which t$_{\textrm{r}}$' measures the time to death. This estimate is the distribution, unrestricted as to form, which maximizes the likelihood of the observations. Other estimates that are discussed are the actuarial estimates (which are also products, but with the number of factors usually reduced by grouping); and reduced-sample (RS) estimates, which require that losses not be accidental, so that the limits of observation (potential loss times) are known even for those items whose deaths are observed. When no losses occur at ages less than t, the estimate of P(t) in all cases reduces to the usual binomial estimate, namely, the observed proportion of survivors.},

Predation by wolves (Canis lupus) and other predators was implicated as the most common cause of death for adult caribou in northeast Alberta. Pregnancy rates (90-100\%) and calf production (75-95\%) were relatively high in all caribou ranges; however, mean annual recruitment was near or below 20 calves per 100 cows in most ranges (x̄ = 17.1, range = 11.4-22.7). Caribou populations in 3 ranges have declined at average rates exceeding those that would lead to a 50\% decline from initial population size over 3 generations; another population is declining at half this rate. Populations of caribou in 2 ranges appear to be stable, declining marginally since inception of our study. The current distribution, intensity, amount, and type of human activity in and near caribou ranges is likely compromising the integrity of caribou habitat. Treatment of declines will require new land-use guidelines that promote caribou conservation.},

Historical data indicate that some local populations were eliminated and that the regional metapopulation declined during the 1970s. Proximate causes of decline may have included hunting, severe winter weather, and the end of predator control, though the ultimate causes may relate to road construction and logging activity, which expanded after 1966. There has been no sport hunting since 1987, yet the caribou populations in the region appear to be declining. Based on serum progesterone levels, first conception by females occurred at 16 months and the overall pregnancy rate was 94\%, and in addition the minimum parturition rate was 86\%, all of which indicate adequate nutrition. The annual survival rate of adults was 84\%, which is comparatively low, though similar to results from other studies on woodland caribou. We observed a low rate of calf recruitment (28 calves : 100 cows), which we suspect was due to predation. Wolves (Canis lupus) have long been thought to limit woodland caribou populations while subsisting on other ungulate prey, but we speculate that black bear (Ursus americanus) predation may be an important cause of poor calf survival.},

	abstract = {In forested ecosystems, estimating the abundance or trend of most wildlife populations is difficult. Therefore, vital rates are often used to model population change, but validating such models is important. Using data from woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus), we compared estimates of population change (λ) based on vital rate models to λ based on aerial censuses. We modeled λ using Hatter and Bergerud’s (1991) recruitment-mortality (R-M) equation (λ = survival/[1 – recruitment]). We estimated survival and recruitment from a sample of 317 radio-collared caribou from 9 subpopulations in British Columbia, Canada. In this ecosystem, woodland caribou have high sightability ({\textgreater}85\%) in winter and thus are easy to census compared to most forest wildlife. We found that the R-M equation overestimated λ compared to census-based λ across most of the observed range of data (e.g., if R-M estimated λ of 1.1, census-based λ was 0.99, and if R-M was 0.90, census-based λ was 0.89). We then assessed whether recruitment, survival, a linear model of both parameters, or the R-M equation best predicted census-based λ. The R-M equation explained 60\% of the variation in census-based λ, more than double the next-best approach (i.e., the simple linear model), even though identical parameters were included. Further, we simulated variability due to the unknown sex (M:F) ratio in the sample, and found that the R-M equation remained the best predictor of census-based λ. Although the R-M equation was the most precise and accurate approach, our results reaffirm that it is important to periodically validate trend estimates based on vital rate models with estimates of absolute abundance, particularly for species of management concern.},

	abstract = {Population monitoring is a critical part of effective wildlife management, but methods are prone to biases that can hinder our ability to accurately track changes in populations through time. Calf survival plays an important role in ungulate population dynamics and can be monitored using telemetry and herd composition surveys. These methods, however, are susceptible to unrepresentative sampling and violations of the assumption of equal detectability, respectively. Here, we capitalized on 55 herd-wide estimates of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) calf survival in Newfoundland, Canada, using telemetry (n = 1,175 calves) and 249 herd-wide estimates of calf:cow ratios (C:C) using herd composition surveys to investigate these potential biases. These data included 17 herd-wide estimates replicated from both methods concurrently (n = 448 calves and n = 17 surveys) which we used to understand which processes and sampling biases contributed to disagreement between estimates of herd-wide calf survival. We used Cox proportional hazards models to determine whether estimates of calf mortality risk were biased by the date a calf was collared. We also used linear mixed-effects models to determine whether estimates of C:C ratios were biased by survey date and herd size. We found that calves collared later in the calving season had a higher mortality risk and that C:C tended to be higher for surveys conducted later in the autumn. When we used these relationships to modify estimates of herd-wide calf survival derived from telemetry and herd composition surveys concurrently, we found that formerly disparate estimates of woodland caribou calf survival now overlapped (within a 95\% confidence interval) in a majority of cases. Our case study highlights the potential of under-appreciated biases to impact our understanding of population dynamics and suggests ways that managers can limit the influence of these biases in the two widely applied methods for estimating herd-wide survival.},

	abstract = {Most research on boreal populations of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) has been conducted in areas of high anthropogenic disturbance. However, a large portion of the species' range overlaps relatively pristine areas primarily affected by natural disturbances, such as wildfire. Climate-driven habitat change is a key concern for the conservation of boreal-dependent species, where management decisions have yet to consider knowledge from multiple ecological domains integrated into a cohesive and spatially explicit forecast of species-specific habitat and demography. We used a novel ecological forecasting framework to provide climate-sensitive projections of habitat and demography for five boreal caribou monitoring areas within the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada, over 90 years. Importantly, we quantify uncertainty around forecasted mean values. Our results suggest habitat suitability may increase in central and southwest regions of the NWT's Taiga Plains ecozone but decrease in southern and northwestern regions driven by conversion of coniferous to deciduous forests. We do not project that boreal caribou population growth rates will change despite forecasted changes to habitat suitability. Our results emphasize the importance of efforts to protect and restore northern boreal caribou habitat despite climate uncertainty while highlighting expected spatial variations that are important considerations for local people who rely on them. An ability to reproduce previous work, and critical thought when incorporating sources of uncertainty, will be important to refine forecasts, derive management decisions, and improve conservation efficacy for northern species at risk.},

	abstract = {Population monitoring can take many different forms, and monitoring elusive and endangered species frequently involves a variety of sparse data from different sources. Small populations are often hard to sample precisely and without bias, so when estimates of vital rates like survival or recruitment point to conflicting population trends, it can be hard to determine which is more correct. Furthermore, data can be extremely hard to collect on small populations and it can be helpful to find a way to use all available hard-won data. To address these issues, we developed an integrated population model (IPM) using all available data to estimate vital rates and abundance for a case study of an endangered woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) population. This IPM allowed us to incorporate data from juvenile recruitment surveys, telemetry-based survival, aerial population counts and mark–resight data, and non-invasive capture–recapture DNA data to better understand population status and trend. We estimated survival, abundance, and recruitment of four age classes of male and female caribou: young, juveniles, subadults, and adults. The four-age class structure of the IPM allowed us to estimate recruitment from reproductive-aged female caribou alone, even though it can be difficult to distinguish age classes—and even sexes—in the field. As part of our IPM, we developed a novel mixture model to break apart data from different age classes when age is unobservable, as it typically is from non-invasive DNA samples. This helped us decrease bias in juvenile and adult survival estimates from scat data, which was important to our understanding of the population dynamics. Overall, our integrated model provided more precise estimates of population trends than any one method (e.g., telemetry or non-invasive DNA) alone. This IPM provides a useful, flexible tool for biologists to monitor populations and provides a valuable example of the benefits of integrated population modeling approaches for endangered species management and recovery.},

The objective of this study was to do an assessment of three endangered caribou subpopulations using non-invasive genetic sampling to assess demographic population changes by combining capture-recapture modeling, familial pedigree networks, individual fitness and inbreeding coefficients. Three subpopulations of the Central Mountain caribou ecotype (Rangifer tarandus caribou) in Jasper National Park, Canada, were systematically surveyed over a 10-year period and fecal samples collected for DNA analyses. For the Tonquin, population size declined at a rate of 0.86 (95\% CI 0.82, 0.91), the number of females decreased from 41 in 2006 to only 14 in 2015. The Brazeau and Maligne subpopulations also declined over the same period, from 22 to 11 individuals (11 and 5 females) in 2006, to 12 and 3 individuals (6 and 1 females) in 2015. The pedigree network confirmed limited interbreeding among subpopulations, varied fitness levels in both males and females, and evidence of inbreeding avoidance among high-fitness individuals. All population parameters pointed to a rapid population decline and low population sizes, putting them at high risk of extinction. The varying reproductive fitness observed amongst males and females was significant and should be considered in future population augmentation or reintroduction efforts. Improved connectivity among and with neighbouring subpopulations should also be considered to sustain or enhance genetic diversity.},

	abstract = {A critical step in recovery efforts for endangered and threatened species is the monitoring of population demographic parameters. As part of these efforts, we evaluated the use of fecal-DNA based capture–recapture methods to estimate population sizes and population rate of change for the North Interlake woodland caribou herd (Rangifer tarandus caribou), Manitoba, Canada. This herd is part of the boreal population of woodland caribou, listed as threatened under the federal Species at Risk Act (2003) and the provincial Manitoba Endangered Species Act (2006). Between 2004 and 2009 (9 surveys), we collected 1,080 fecal samples and identified 180 unique genotypes (102 females and 78 males). We used a robust design survey plan with 2 surveys in most years and analysed the data with Program MARK to estimate encounter rates (p), apparent survival rates (φ), rates of population change (λ), and population sizes (N). We estimated these demographic parameters for males and females and for 2 genetic clusters within the North Interlake. The population size estimates were larger for the Lower than the Upper North Interlake area and the proportion of males was lower in the Lower (33\%) than the Upper North Interlake (49\%). Population rate of change for the entire North Interlake area (2005–2009) using the robust design Pradel model was significantly {\textless}1.0 (λ = 0.90, 95\% CI: 0.82–0.99) and varied between sex and area with the highest being for males in Lower North Interlake (λ = 0.98, 95\% CI: 0.83–1.13) and the lowest being for females in Upper North Interlake (λ = 0.83, 95\% CI: 0.69–0.97). The additivity of λ between sex and area is supported on the log scale and translates into males having a λ that is 0.09 greater than females and independent of sex, Lower North Interlake having a λ that is 0.06 greater than Upper North Interlake. Population estimates paralleled these declining trends, which correspond to trends observed in other fragmented populations of woodland caribou along the southern part of their range. The results of this study clearly demonstrate the applicability and success of non-invasive genetic sampling in monitoring populations of woodland caribou. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.},
