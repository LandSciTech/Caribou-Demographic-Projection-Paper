# Model of bias in recruitment estimates from calf:cow surveys

TO DO: get photo of calf:cow survey group. Label classes of animals to illustrate meaning of T, U, V, W, O, P, J, K.

We assume each group of animals in a calf:cow composition survey contains one or more collared adult females ($T$), and may also include: uncollared adult females misidentified as young bulls or unknown sex ($U$); correctly identified uncollared adult females ($V$); young bulls correctly identified as male or unknown sex ($O$); young bulls misidentified as uncollared adult females ($P$); observed calves ($J$); and unobserved calves ($K$). The apparent number of adult females in the group is $T+V+P=Tw$, where $w$ is a multiplier that defines the apparent number of adult females as a function of the number of collared animals. The ratio of young bulls to uncollared adult females in the group is:
$$q = \frac{P+O}{U+V}.$$
Assuming an equal probability $u$ of misidentifying young bulls as adult females and vice versa, we get $V=(U+V)(1-u)$ and $P=(O+P)u$. Given a probability $z$ of missing calves, we get $J=(J+K)(1-z)$.

Our objective is to model the sex and bias-corrected recruitment rate $X=\frac{J+K}{2(T+U+V)}$ as a function of the observed calf:cow ratio $R=J/(T+V+P)$, the cow multiplier $w$, the ratio of young bulls to adult females $q$, and the misidentification probabilities $u$ and $z$. We start by solving for $T+U+V$ as a function of $q,w,u$ and $T$. Recognize that $P=Tw-T-V$, $U+V=V/(1-u)$, and $P+O=P/u$ to write $q$ as 
$$q=\frac{Tw-T-V}{uV/(1-u)}.$$
Rearrange to get 
$$V=\frac{T(w-1)(1-u)}{qu+1-u}.$$
Recognize that $U=Vu/(1-u)$ to write $T+U+V$ as a function of $q,w,u$ and $T$: 
$$T+U+V=T\frac{qu+w-u}{qu+1-u}.$$
Recognize that the number of observed calves $J$ is the product of the apparent recruitment rate and the apparent number of adult females $J=RTw$, and that therefore $J+K=RTw/(1-z)$ to rewrite the bias corrected recruitment rate $X=\frac{J+K}{2(T+U+V)}$ as a function of $w,u,z$ and $R$:
$$X=R\frac{w(1+qu-u)}{2(w+qu-u)(1-z)}.$$
For simplicity, we write $X$ as a function of a bias correction term $c$: 
$$c=\frac{w(1+qu-u)}{(w+qu-u)(1-z)}; X=cR/2$$

If we also adjust for delayed age at first reproduction (DeCesare et al. 2012; Eacker et al. 2019), the adjusted recruitment rate becomes $$X=\frac{cR/2}{1+cR/2}.$$

If only collared females are counted ($w=1$) and there is a risk of missing calves $z>0$ then the apparent recruitment rate $R$ will be lower than $X$ (first column). When uncollared animals are counted ($w>1$), the risk of misidentifying adults $u$ inflates the apparent recruitment rate $R$ as on average more cows are misidentified as bulls than vice versa, but this effect is smaller than the effect of missing calves $z$. Increasing the proportion of bulls in the group $q$ reduces the effect of adult misidentification $u$.", fig.height=6,cache=TRUE}

Prior parameter values should be set so that, given no monitoring data, the prior survival distribution is similar to the distribution of simulated outcomes from the national model in the case of no anthropogenic disturbance. This condition is met when the multiplier on the prior standard deviation of the survival intercept (sIntSEMod: $\beta^S_0$ in Table 2) is 5 and the mean and standard deviations of the prior distribution of the random effect of year on survival are low  (SigmaMean & SigmaSD, $\sigma^2_S$ in Table 2) (Figs \@ref(fig:PriorKSDists) and \@ref(fig:PriorAllFits)). Priors should also be vague enough so that, given intensive monitoring of populations where survival is higher or lower than the national average ('High' and 'Low' scenarios: 15 years of 60 collars per year from 97.5% and 2.5% quantiles of the national model), posteriors reflect local survival, rather than priors from the national model. Setting the mean and standard deviations of the prior distribution of the random effect of year on survival to moderately low values (SigmaMean=0.034784, SigmaSD=0.03, $\sigma^2_S$ in Table 2) allows both conditions to be met (Figs \@ref(fig:PriorKSDists), \@ref(fig:PriorAllFits) and \@ref(fig:PriorLowFits)).
